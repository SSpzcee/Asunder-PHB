## **Weapon D-rank**

### **Asahi \- Rising Sun**

A simple yet effective technique that utilizes the leverage of a weapon to deliver a deceptively fast upward strike.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \-3  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Neutral/Earth Stance  
Type: Melee

Effect:   
If no enemies act between this Attack and your next Non-Interrupt Weapon Attack, then that Attack may have its Base Speed halved for all purposes should you choose to. To a minimum of Base Speed 3\.

Stance Shift: Heaven Stance

### **Raaki \- Falling Moon**

A simple yet effective technique that utilizes the leverage of a weapon to deliver a deceptively fast upward strike.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 4  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Heaven/Wrath Stance  
Type: Melee

Effect:   
If your last Weapon Attack happened within the past 10 ICs, and no enemies have acted since, then this Weapon Jutsu will count as 1 Speed higher for Damage Purposes per every Speed reduction this Jutsu has from any source.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

### **Uneru Nami \- Rolling Waves**

The technique itself is simply a strong upward strike utilizing the weapon’s weight to add more leverage to the attack, either by starting from the ground, or bouncing the weapon off of a different surface (such as a wall, to every bricklayer's dismay) in order to bring it back up with speed. For some it’s a true stance they keep whilst utilizing their weapon, and others it’s just following the movements of their opponents as they swing upward toward them. Many a Kirigakure Genin have been found in the training grounds debating the complexity (or lack thereof) of this technique.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 6  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: 12 \+ (Weapon’s Speed/2)  
Delay: As Weapon \+ 4  
Requires: Earth/Void Stance  
Type: Medium/Large/Extreme Melee, Slashing/Blunt, Sword/Club/Polearm

Effect:   
Any positive or negative Accuracy your Weapon or Stance has for this Technique is negated (as though the Weapon or Stance had no bonus or penalty to Accuracy). For every \-1 Accuracy Penalty removed, this Jutsu gains a \+2 increase to its Damage Bonus. And for every \+1 Accuracy Bonus removed it, it gains a \-1 reduction to its Stamina cost and Delay.

Stance Shift: Wrath Stance

### **Kashiraheki \- Headsplitter**

Hoisting your weapon into the perfect position, taking your time to figure out the perfect swing, you bring it across directly into your target, or perhaps from above, with disastrous results\! Unfortunately, while this may be perfect for exploding someone's brains out, it's pretty obvious you are getting ready to do just that\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+8  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+6  
Delay: As Weapon \+2  
Requires: Heaven/Wrath Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Blunt, Sword/Club

Effects:  
This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Head. This technique will change your Stance to Broken instead of Neutral if you miss with it. 

The Damage Bonus of this Attack is increased by \+50%. 

Every 50 damage dealt by this technique gives the victim a \-1 penalty to Accuracy which lasts until their next attack or accuracy roll. If you deal more than 400 damage, for 50 IC whenever they perform any non-Area Attack, they must roll 1d2; on 1, their Attack functions normally. On 2, they have a \-5 Accuracy penalty due to disorientation and double vision

### **Nenten Tsuki \- Twisting Stab**

The user lunges forward while turning their wrist, drilling their weapon into the opponent, using chakra to enhance their momentum. It is very effective at breaking an opponent's guard as you spin the weapon to go around their defense.

Stamina: As Weapon \+2  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: 10 \+ (Weapon's Speed/5)  
Special: \-1 Accuracy  
Requires: Paper Stance  
Type: Melee, Piercing, Sword/Polearm

Effects:  
Any Defensive Interrupts performed against this Jutsu treat their Speed as if it was double what it actually is for the purpose of Defense Validity. If you miss completely, you enter the Broken Stance and the Speed of this Attack is increased by 3 for IC purposes, as you lunge and lose your balance

### **Ichi no Hoshi \- One Star**

By unfolding their fan only a third of the way, the user creates a small but biting gust of wind that is useful for its capacity to strike at targets far away while wielding a weapon.

Chakra: As Weapon  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon  
Delay: As Weapon  
Range: CHA/4  
Type: Melee, Fan

Effects:  
This attack uses your ninjutsu damage bonus, rather than your physical damage bonus. The Chakra cost of this technique is the same as, and replaces, the Fan’s normal Stamina cost. This attack can only be parried by things which state they can parry Ninjutsu.

### **Hamukau Kanjin \- Vital Strike**

Whether it be to cut someone's achilles tendon, or to gouge their eye out, weapons have many ways to disable or execute their wielder's opponents. Sneaking past your opponent's defenses and getting in even one good attack can change a fight, or end a life\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+4  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Neutral/Heaven/Earth/Void Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Piercing, Sword/Polearm/Chain/Fan

Effects:  
You may give yourself a penalty of up to \-(STR/10) Accuracy Penalty.

For every \-1 Accuracy Penalty, this Attack's Damage is increased by 10% for the purposes of inflicting wounds.

Even without any penalty, Partial Defenses are ineffective against this Attack, meaning that you still get full Damage.

Stance Shift: Paper Stance.

### **Fukumikuchi Hari \- Hidden Mouth Needles**

The user is able to summon needles from within their mouth and spit them at their opponents with force comparative to have been thrown. It's useful at point-blank range for catching the opponent by surprise, but becomes predictable with repeated use.

Stamina: As senbon multi-throw, \+3  
Chakra: 10, \+X  
Damage: As senbon multi-throw  
Speed: As senbon multi-throw, \-2  
Type: Senbon

Effects:  
This allows you to perform a multi-throw with senbon, following normal multi-throw rules, even without the ability which would normally allow you to do so. If you can multi-throw senbon without using this jutsu, it instead becomes an automatic Surprise Attack.  
X is the number of times you have previously used this technique in the same battle.  
Though this jutsu can be used as often as you wish, it may only be used as a Surprise Attack once every 100 IC; after that, it's just not surprising.

### **Kage Shuriken no Jutsu \- Shadow Shuriken Technique**

The user throws multiple Shuriken at the same time, positioning them in such a way that one or more weapons can hide within the shadow of another in flight, making the lower one(s) virtually invisible.

Stamina: 22  
Damage: As Weapon(s)  
Speed: 22  
Type: Large Ranged

Effects:  
You throw two of the same weapon, each doing their normal base damage, and using half this technique's Speed to determine how much they benefit from your damage bonus.

If this hits and partial defense does not apply, combine the damage of the two weapons. If it hits and partial defense does apply, one misses entirely and the other does full damage (not reduced by partial defense).

### **Mukadesuto \- Centipede Pincers**

Using two weapons in conjunction with one another, the user strikes repeatedly, flowing from one strike to the next in a barrage of attacks that can quickly overwhelm most opponents.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Void Stance, Dual Wield Attack  
Type: Small/Medium Melee, Dual

Effects:  
Each time this attack is consecutively used (even if it misses\!) the total Speed of the attack is reduced by 1, to a minimum of half its original value. Additionally, the number of dice on each weapon is increased by 1\.

These benefits reset if you make a non-Interrupt action other than a dual-wielded attack with your weapons or movement, or if you go for 15 IC or more without using this jutsu.

Stance Shift: Void Stance

### **Kusari no Hebi \- Chain Serpent**

With sufficient practice, the user can throw their chain weapon in such a way that it ricochets to strike their opponent multiple times, hitting and disarming them or tripping them at the same time, tugging on the chain to redirect it.

Stamina: As Weapon \+4  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+ 4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Type: Chain

Effects:  
If this hits, in addition to dealing damage you may attempt to either perform the E-rank taijutsu technique Trip or perform a Disarm against a weapon they're holding as a Speed 0 Interrupt. The Stamina costs and Speeds of these actions are included in this technique and they are considered to be the Speed of this attack for the purpose of what is considered a valid defence.

### **Omo Hoshiga \- Double Star Fang**

Several enemies running at an archer and getting in close could mean the end for an archer, but luckily you can fend them off\! Quickly drawing several arrows out, you load them all into your bow and fire them off in different directions. This would be hard for most people, but luckily you're a ninja.

Stamina: (As Weapon) \+ 5 \* X  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: As Weapon  
Speed: (As Weapon) \+ 3 \* X  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
You may target up to three additional people with this Attack; X is the number of people beyond the first who you Attack. This jutsu uses half your physical damage bonus

### **Soushuriken no Jutsu \- Manipulated Shuriken Technique**

You connect a thin, nearly invisible wire to shuriken or kunai when throwing them so that you can redirect them mid-air, or even attack people around corners or behind trees\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+3  
Damage: As Weapons  
Speed: As Weapon \+3  
Type: Small Thrown Weapons  
Requires: Ninja Wire

Effects:  
If you miss with this technique you can make an Accuracy roll with a \+4 bonus; if this hits, your attack hits but uses only half your damage bonus.  
You can also attack a person who you don't have line of sight on (say, they're around a corner) if you can somehow accurately perceive them; in this case the above paragraph does not apply and this technique has a \-2 Accuracy penalty.  
Used with a multi-throw attack, this increases the total Stamina and Speed of that action by the appropriate amount.  
The increase in damage bonus from multi-throwing (+0.5 per weapon thrown) is also halved by this technique if the Accuracy roll is used.  
The total of Ninja Wire required is the range at which you make this attack, multiplied by the number of weapons thrown. This does not need to be prepared in advance; you do it on the spot and use precisely the right amount of wire, via your ninja trickery.

### **Teki Tettai \- Tactical Retreat**

A Swift retreat is never permanent\! This attack demonstrates With swift precision, the user retreats gracefully, positioning themselves to evade counterattacks and assess their next move.

Stamina: As Weapon \+3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \-4  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Piercing, Sword/Chain/Polearm

Effects: After you hit with this Attack, you are able to move backwards (away from the Target and in the opposite direction you just attacked towards) to a maximum distance equal to the Final Speed of this Attack for free.

Stance Shift: Steel

## **Weapon C-rank**

### **Kousanami \- Cross Wave**

A versatile and elegant technique, although one with an infinite room for mastery. The weapon master brings their weapon up or down in a sequence of diagonal, or horizontal, or vertical slashes. Depending entirely on which stance they initially started in. This technique gets its name from the figure-eight motion the shinobi ends up drawing with their blade no matter which form their assault takes.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 8  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: 15 \+ (weapon's Speed)/2  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Heaven/Earth/Void Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing

Effects:  
This Jutsu gains an additional effect based on the Stance you were in when you initiated this Jutsu:

Heaven Stance: Your Attack's Damage is not mitigated by DR.  
Earth Stance: Your Attack cannot be Blocked and negates the benefits of the Target's Stand.  
Void Stance: Your Attack is treated as a Surprise Attack.

Cross Wave has only a single Accuracy, and is treated as one Attack. However, if the opponent uses a Defense where they roll for a result (such as Dodge or Parry), they must roll twice.

If the Attack hits the first Defense, that roll is used to determine how much Partial Defense, if any, is applied. If the second Defense also fails (Partial Defense being ignored for this purpose), your Attack's Dice Damage is quadrupled (From, for example, 5d8, to 5d8\*4)

If the attack misses against your opponent's first defensive roll, make the second roll. If it hits, this attack deals damage as a regular attack with your weapons (with the higher Speed associated with this technique). Meaning that you do not apply multiplied Dice Damage.

If you are using a two-handed weapon (such as a Nodachi or Zanbato), which would normally multiply your Damage Bonus by 50%, you do not receive that increase when using Cross Wave.

### **Hirameku Yaiba \- Flash Blade**

Using the principles of Iaijutsu, the user takes up a readied stance and, using a surge of chakra, rushes their opponent to take them by surprise, redrawing the weapon and striking in one quick movement.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+ 4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Neutral/Earth Stance  
Type: Melee, Sword 

Effects:  
Make an Initiative Roll, opposed by your opponent's; they have a cumulative \+2 bonus for each time you've used this (successfully or not) in this battle. If you fail, you perform a Basic Weapon Attack attack.

If you succeed, your attack receives the benefits of the Iaijutsu Ability, even if you've used that earlier in battle.

Stance Shift: Heaven Stance

### **Kashiwa no Hishou \- Oak Flight**

Circling something large and blunt over your head, you slam it into your opponent after a few rotations and completely daze them. A powerful enough strike put in the right place makes it hard for the enemy to focus on you, or even gives them a bit of double-vision.

Stamina: As Weapon \+5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+5  
Type: Blunt

Effects:

### **Ni-Tōbun \- Bisection**

Requiring as much brute strength as perfect technique, this attack is a powerful downward strike that aims to split the target in half. Most of the force behind this fearsome slash is generated by capitalizing on the weapon's weight and the force of gravity, the weapon master's own muscles are mostly taxed in the effort of directing the heavy chunk of steel in the right direction to deliver a decisive and devastating blow which can cleave through guards, armor, and flesh and bone with equal ease. While simple in theory, the weapon master that is capable of performing such a brutal slash while maintaining perfect edge alignment is widely feared and respected.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 10  
Damage: As Special  
Speed: 15 \+ (Weapon's Speed/3)  
Delay: As Weapon \+ 4  
Special: \- 2 Accuracy Penalty  
Requires: Wrath Stance, STR 100  
Type: Medium/Large/Extreme Melee, Slashing, Sword/Polearm

Effects:   
This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Torso. Multiply the Total Damage of this Attack by 2\.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

### **Surīburesu To-Resshō \- Three Breaths Dissolving Cut**

They say that a true master of the sword is able to cut down anybody, no matter who they were, within the span of three breaths. This technique is an expansion of that idea where the weapon master focuses on striking as many opponents as possible within an equally short time span by dashing through or past them faster than the eye can blink. Even though this technique has "Cut" in its name, it is also one favored by many spearmen who are able to run through many poor victims at once.

Stamina: X \+ (Weapon’s Stamina Cost)  
Damage: As Weapon   
Speed: X \+ (Weapon’s Speed/2)  
Delay: As Weapon   
Requires: Steel/Earth Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Piercing, Sword/Polearm

Effects: This Jutsu can only be performed with a "Move with an Attack" Maneuver.  Calculate your "Move with an Attack" move distance as if you have moved for X amount of ICs, where X has a maximum of 5\. Your "Move with an Attack" maneuver must be a straight line, but it does not need to target any specific enemy, its target can be a location. Every enemy within that line must defend against this attack or they'll get hit by it. 

Stance Shift: Void Stance

### **Haganekabe \- Steel Wall**

By spinning their weapon rapidly with both hands, the weapon master deflects ranged attacks aimed at them as they close in on their opponents, and then use the momentum gained by the rotation to finish with a powerful swing.

Stamina: As Weapon \+5  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: As Weapon \-2  
Delay: As Weapon  
Type: Melee, Slashing, Polearm/Chain

Effects:  
When you use this technique, you begin spinning your weapon; so long as you keep doing this you may Parry incoming Ranged Taijutsu Attacks as a Speed 0 Interrupt with a \+5 bonus, but both your hands and your weapon are occupied (Meaning they cannot be used). Anyone attempting to attack you in Melee has their Action's Speed increased by 4, as they need to get around your weapon.

Furthermore, if this Jutsu was used with a Chain Weapon, then every (Weapon’s Delay \* 2\) ICs that somebody spends within the Range of your weapon while you maintain this Upkeep, you can perform a free Basic Weapon Attack against  

Stance Shift: Steel

### **Mawarisuto \- Rotation Strike**

Extending out a polearm, you hold one end with both hands then commence whirling and spinning the polearm around yourself in large circles\! If it has a blade of some sort, this is even better\!\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+8  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+10  
Requires: Polearm

Effects:  
You may attack anyone you choose within range 3\. If you choose to target only one person with this attack it has \+2 Accuracy.

### **Raikogeki \- Thundering Strike**

Drawing your weapon back and then lunging out quickly, you make a precise strike aiming to injure, hopefully cause them to bleed out a bit. Despite the slightly weakened nature of this strike, it's rather unnerving to be poked full of holes.

Stamina: As Weapon \+2  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \-4 (Minimum 3\)  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Paper/Void Stance  
Type: Melee, Piercing, Sword/Polearm

Effects:  
This inflicts Bleed 2\. If used against a Target who is already suffering this Status Condition, this Jutsu instead increases the highest Bleed's severity by 1\.

Stance Shift: Paper

### **Goryū Rizumu no Jutsu \- Rumbling Dragon Beat Technique**

(Flavor Text)

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 7  
Damage: Special  
Speed: As Weapon \+ 10  
Delay: As Weapon   
Requires: Heaven/Wrath Stance  
Type: Large/Extreme Melee, Blunt, Club/Polearm

Effect: You strike the ground with your weapon and cause a miniature earthquake within an Area equal in size to your PDB (Rounded Down). Everybody that stands in that Area must roll to Dodge, after determining if they take any Area based Dodge penalties. This cannot be Parried or Blocked. If a Target fails their Defense, then they take half your Total Damage and fall Prone. 

Additionally, the ground in that area is permanently destroyed, becoming very unsteady terrain. Anybody that stands in that section of the battlefield (including you) will have their movement speed halved for all purposes as they can never find proper footing.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

### **Kuro Budounoki \- Black Vines**

A technique popularized by a Nara who liked to utilize a black-painted Kusari-Gama to strike from the shadows with a weapon when his opponents waited for them to move, you channel a small amount of chakra within your weapon and temporarily disconnect portions of it in order to extend its range beyond what an opponent would expect, grabbing hold and forcibly pulling them back to you for a follow-up strike.

Stamina: (Weapon) \+ 10  
Damage: Special  
Range: (Weapon) \+ NDB \* 2  
Speed: 10 \+ (weapon’s speed)/2  
Type: Chain

Effects:   
Make a Grab attempt with your weapon; if successful, you then begin a Grapple with your opponent and immediately pull them toward you until they are at Distance 0 with you. You can put them on any ‘side’ of you besides your back (Opposite of the side you attacked towards), if you wish, as part of this process.

Afterward you make a Basic Weapon Attack: If you’re holding two weapons, this can be with either one, using its normal Speed with a bonus of \+Xd\*, where X is the number of yards you pulled them toward you, to a maximum of double your weapon’s base dice. If you manage to wound your target with this, they take a \-2 to their Grapple rolls against you per severity of the Wound (-2 for Minor, \-4 for Major, etc), which lasts until the Grapple is broken.

If something prevents their movement toward you (such as being grappled by someone else who resists their movement, being tied up to a tree, or stuck in an Immobility 10 effect), then this technique has no effect other than establishing a grapple (which might end automatically, if they are beyond your normal grapple range).

AP spent to lower this Technique’s speed lowers both the speed you perform it at, Which is used for both the Grab and Attack to determine Valid Interrupts, and the speed for the damage of the Weapon Attack performed.

### **Ni no Hoshi \- Two Star**

Opening the fan two-thirds of the way for this attack, the user lets out a strong gust of wind, hopefully blowing their opponents away\!

Chakra: As Weapon \+5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: CHA/4  
Speed: As Weapon \+5  
Delay: As Weapon  
Type: Fan

Effects:  
This uses your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, plus one-fourth of your Physical Damage Bonus, and applies a Knockback of (PDB/2) Yards on hit. This attack can only be parried by things which state they can parry Ninjutsu.

### **Itowotoosu \- Thread the Needle**

Attaching Ninja Wire to the end of an arrow, the shinobi fires and uses chakra to alter the course of the arrow in mid-flight. This makes the shot extremely hard to avoid, at the cost of leaving a wire leading back to the point of origin.

Stamina: As Weapon+8  
Chakra: 18  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+8  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
Every 10 yards you are from the opponent when firing adds \+1 to the Accuracy of this attack. Using this technique expends an amount of ninja wire equal to the distance between you and its target. After this attack is resolved, you are automatically removed from stealth (if you were hidden to begin with).

### **Chakura Nagashi \- Chakra Flow**

A technique which increases the potency of a weapon by running currents of chakra through it to enhance its existing properties or adapt it to a situation. The user must remain in physical contact with the weapon to sustain the flow of chakra, making this only effective with melee weapons.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Requires: Chakra Control 15, appropriate Elemental Aptitude  
Type: Melee

Effects:  
While you maintain this technique, your weapons gain the properties of your elemental affinity. When used against ninjutsu-based defenses, the weapon is considered to be of the relevant element to determine how effective the defense is against it. Additionally, it gains an additional effect based on the element chosen (listed below). This technique does receive your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls from the Elemental Affinity ability.  
If you're using Dual Weapons, Chakra Flow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Chakra Flow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from your Chakra Flow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives Chakra Flow's effects as a Speed 0 action. Weapons created through jutsu can only be affected by chakra flow of their creation element.

* Earth: Your weapon gains Stun 2, or \+2 to its existing Stun. Every time somebody already stunned is struck by your weapon, their Stun is increased by 1\. Anyone who parries your weapon successfully suffers the Stun 2 (or \+1).  
* Fire: You add one third of your ninjutsu damage bonus to your regular damage bonus when using your weapon. To determine damage you multiply your attack's damage by its base speed, rather than modified speed.  
* Lightning: Any weapon that parries yours, or which yours parries, has a cumulative 10% chance of breaking and becoming unusable each time. Any damage reduction an opponent has is halved, and you ignore the effects of any armor they're wearing. Additionally, any time you inflict a wound with the weapon, your opponent suffers a Paralysis status of 1 per severity of the Wound (1 for Minor, 2 for Major, etc) for 10 IC (if the wound is somehow negated or ignored, they negate or ignore the Paralysis as well).  
* Water: Water's inherent fluidity and adaptability give you \+2 Accuracy, and an additional \+2 when parrying.  
* Wind: The efficacy of blocking is reduced by 30%, and your damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds upon your enemies

This is complicated slightly when two weapons augmented by Chakra Flow interact, one parrying or being parried by the other. In these cases, if one of the elements is strong against the other, the weaker element's

Chakra Flow effects are ignored for the purpose of that parry. As a reminder: Fire beats Wind; Wind beats Lightning; Lightning beats Earth;

Earth beats Water; and Water beats Fire. This doesn't apply if the parry fails (if your Water weapon fails to parry their Fire sword, it still does that extra damage to you), but in the case of Earth vs. Water, does allow an Earth weapon to attempt to parry a Water one.

If you have an advanced elemental chakra nature (such as a Senju's Mokuton), you choose which of the two appropriate effects you're using when you activated Chakra Flow. For example, as a Senju you could receive either Earth's stunning or Water's accuracy and parry effects. You cannot change which you've chosen without ending and then re-activating Chakra Flow.

Despite this, it's still considered to be the advanced element when put up against ninjutsu defenses.

## **Weapon B-rank**

### **Hashadan \- Blade Breaker**

You deliver an overwhelmingly powerful blow, often an overhead strike, with all the force you can muster behind it; what it gains in force it loses in precision, but its real purpose is to destroy any weapons used by the victim for defense.

Stamina: \+10 or \+X  
Speed: \+0  
Type: Melee, not Small

Effects:  
This is used alongside any other attack with the weapon, including weapon taijutsu. If the attack is successfully parried or blocked by a weapon, the defender makes a Stamina roll. The normal \+5 bonus to Stamina rolls per level of Fatigue is replaced with a \-3 penalty (so someone at Fatigue 3 would have a \-9 penalty, instead of a \+15 bonus).  
The result of their roll becomes the X added to your attack's cost. Thus, if you used Blade Breaker with a Katana (Stamina 12), and your opponent parried your attack and rolled a 14 on their Stamina roll, the total Stamina cost would be (12+14) 26\. The weapon used to defend against your attack is destroyed.  
If your attack is not (successfully) blocked or parried, its Stamina cost is increased by 10 instead. If it is, but the enemy's weapon cannot be destroyed for any reason, the Stamina cost is increased only by 5\.  
This will destroy weapons created by Water-Cutting Blade and Earth-Smashing Staff, but not Burning Spear. The destruction of the enemy weapon takes place after their defense is resolved (breaking the sword which parried your attack does not prevent your attack from having been parried).

### **Hontō No Seigi \- True Justice**

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 4  
Damage: As Weapon   
Speed: 5 \+ Special  
Delay: As Weapon   
Requires: Heaven/Earth/Steel/Paper/Neutral/Void Stance  
Type: Melee

Effects:   
This Jutsu is used as a Weapon Parry with a \+2 Bonus. If you successfully defend, then you may immediately follow up with a specific Attack depending on the Stance you were in beforehand at no extra Stamina cost to you:

Heaven: Falling Moon  
Earth: Rising Sun  
Steel: Tactical Retreat  
Paper: Twisting Stab  
Neutral: Basic Weapon Attack  
Void: Any of the above

You use the results of your Parry roll as your Attack's Accuracy and increase that Jutsu's Speed for both damage and legal defenses by 5\. You may augment this Attack as you would normal attacks and this allows for attack-movement as part of it while it is an attack. This does mean that Sudden Attack and like bonuses would apply and can be declared as the attack is declared. Afterwards, you Shift your Stance according to whichever Jutsu you used.

### **Chakura Nagashi Shuusei \- Chakra Flow Modification**

Converting one's chakra to an element other than their affinity is difficult; doing so with chakra flow is even more so, as it requires converting your chakra to the desired element, then reabsorbing it in a continuous stream.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 12  
Speed: 10  
Requires: Chakra Control 25, Chakra Flow  
Type: Melee

Effects:  
As the C-rank Chakra Flow, but you may use elements other than your affinity. You may only maintain one element of Chakra Flow at a time, even if you're holding two weapons.  
You must be able to use ninjutsu of the appropriate  
element in order to infuse your weapons with that element of chakra.

### **Hien \- Flying Swallow**

This technique expands upon the concepts developed when learning the Chakra Flow technique. Instead of altering the nature of chakra flowing through their weapon, the shinobi changes the shape. This is used to expand the striking or cutting surfaces of the weapon with an invisible chakra blade, point, or blunt end.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 10  
Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow  
Type: Melee

Effects:  
The Reach of your Melee Weapon increases by 2, and its Dice amount is increased by 2\. This does mean that your weapon no longer triggers most On-Contact effects.

If you're using Dual Weapons, Flying Swallow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Flying Swallow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Flying Swallow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Tsubasa Migaku \- Blade Honing**

Despite being a fairly simple technique in concept, the precision necessary to perform it effectively, and without damaging one's blade, limits its use to more skilled shinobi.  
Focusing chakra along the edge of a bladed weapon, the user creates a 'second', sharper blade of chakra that essentially increases the weapon's sharpness, and also protects the blade itself from dulling.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: X/2 (round up)  
Speed: 10  
Type: Slashing

Effects:  
Your weapon deals X extra dice of damage, but its damage is reduced by (X\*5)% for the purpose of determining wounds. X has a maximum of (your Chakra Control skill ranks)/3.  
If you're using Dual Weapons, Blade Honing applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Blade Honing at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Blade Honing. If holding two nonDual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Ryuuketsu Ibara \- Bloody Thorns**

This technique coats the tip of a piercing weapon with a thin layer of chakra which reacts to puncturing a victim's flesh.  
When it does so, the chakra immediately forms a number of small thorns which tear the victim's flesh when the weapon is pulled out. The 'spikes' then return to being nothing but formless chakra, ready for the next attack.  
Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 10  
Type: Piercing

Effects:  
Your weapon inflicts Bleed 1 whenever it deals damage. If the victim has an existing Bleed status, it increases that status by 2\. This explicitly stacks with the C rank Thundering Strike (meaning it's Bleed 3, or \+3, if paired with Thundering Strike).  
If you're using Dual Weapons, Bloody Thorns applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Bloody Thorns at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Bloody Thorns. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Haruichiban \- First Storm of Spring**

The user of this technique throws multiple oversized  
shuriken in quick succession, pausing just long enough between each throw to correct for their opponent's movements.

Stamina: 14 \+ X \* 8  
Damage: ( (4 \+ STR/12) \* X)d12  
Accuracy: \-3  
Range: STR/3  
Speed: 12 \+ X \* 5  
Type: Large Thrown

Effects:  
You throw X Fuuma Shuriken or Large Star Shuriken, up to a maximum of STR/35 (May never exceed 4); all the weapons you throw must be of the same type. If this hits normally, its damage is increased by 5% per point it hits by (if Fuuma Shuriken were used), or 10% per point it hits by (if Large Star Shuriken were used); this is then reduced by partial defense normally.  
If Haruichiban misses, lower X by 1, its Speed by an additional 4, and raise its Accuracy by 3\. Repeat this until Haruichiban hits or X is 0\.  
This effect does not alter Haruichiban's Stamina cost, or what its Speed is for determining when your next action comes (in other words: it lowers the number of dice rolled, and the Speed for damage calculations, only).  
Partial defense is less effective than normal against Haruichiban; for each point it hits by, it deals 25% of its full damage.

### **Tentai-ite no Jutsu \- Celestial Archer Technique**

Every once in a while a shinobi gets it into their head that it would be a good idea to use a bow as their primary method of fighting. This rarely ends well, but the shinobi flair for the dramatic is often powerful enough to override both their good judgement, and any good advice they may receive. This technique was developed by those sorts of shinobi, in an attempt to make their weapon of choice less painfully impractical.  
The user concentrates chakra in their arms, speeding up their draw speed and allowing them to subconsciously correct their aim in an instant. The downside is that they sacrifice a great deal of power when doing this--but, as many users of it will assert, the technique is "way too awesome" for that to be a serious concern.

Stamina: 15  
Upkeep: 2 \+ X/3  
Speed: 6  
Requires: 2 ranks in Weapon Focus: Bow  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
While you maintain this technique's Upkeep, your bow's Accuracy penalty is reduced by X. If X is set higher than the value of your bow's Accuracy penalty (for example, you set X \= 10 and are using a Yumi), consider X to be just enough to eliminate the penalty for this technique's other effects.  
The base Speed of your bow is reduced by X/2, and the number of dice of damage it rolls is reduced by X. Your damage bonus when using your bow, after being multiplied as appropriate for the weapon you're using, is also reduced by X.  
Your damage bonus or number of dice cannot be reduced to 0 or lower; if they would, you are incapable of maintaining Celestial Archer at that level.

### **Gen'ei Tousekiki \- Phantom Ballista**

A distant derivative of the ubiquitous chakra flow technique, this concentrates chakra around the user's wrists and forearms. When an arrow is drawn back in a bow that chakra extends to wrap around it, and lingers long enough after being fired to strengthen the impact. More ambitious users can even form arrows out of pure chakra, though doing so rapidly puts a strain on their reserves.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 8 or 12  
Speed: 12  
Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
While this technique is maintained, your arrows deal an extra (CHA/12) dice of damage. For the purposes of ninjutsu-based defenses they are treated as being a ninjutsu attack of your elemental affinity (Upkeep 8\) or any element you have the ability to use (Upkeep 12), declared when you activate this technique. If you use your elemental affinity, the Chakra roll does receive the appropriate bonus.  
Additionally, you may create arrows out of pure chakra.  
Attacking with these arrows replaces your bow's normal Stamina cost with an equivalent Chakra cost \+5 (a Daikyu, Stamina 20, would become Chakra 25). These deal (CHA/8) dice of damage, and use (ninjutsu damage bonus \+ physical damage bonus)/2 in place of your normal physical damage bonus. These arrows use d12 for their damage if used with a Daikyu, or d6 with a Yumi.  
These arrows have a faint glow about them until they hit, a result of the chakra enhancing them. This tends to draw attention. When attacking from Stealth with Phantom Ballista (either a normal arrow, or one created from chakra) your Stealth TN is reduced by 7 (rather than 5).

## **Weapon A-rank**

### **Mikazuki no Mai \- Crescent Moon Dance**

Originally developed in Kiri, the technique has since been  
imitated and reconstructed in other villages. The user attacks at high speed, using a pair of clones to attack the target's blind spots; this actually consists of several strikes in quick succession, the user changing location after each and losing themselves among their clones. Understandably, this makes an effective defense against the technique difficult to come up with.  
Ideally, this technique is performed using Shadow Clones; other varieties of clones work, though are less effective, and in a pinch a ninja can briefly create the necessary clones as part of the technique, though doing so is draining on their chakra, and the clones disappear immediately afterwards.

Stamina: 30 \+ (Weapon)  
Damage: Four times the normal amount of dice rolled by your weapon.  
Chakra: 30 \- 15 \* X  
Speed: 20  
Delay: 15 \- 5 \* X  
Type: Sword

Effects:  
X is the number of Shadow Clones you have armed with weapons which can be used with this technique, up to a maximum of 2\. Crescent Moon Dance is always considered a surprise attack, and defending against it must be done as if it was half its actual Speed (if you used 5 AP to reduce it to Speed 15, it would count as Speed 8; this would require a Speed 4 or lower Interrupt to defend against Crescent Moon Dance).  
Clones used with this technique must have the same weapon you do and be capable of attacking and dealing damage. If you have two or more such clones that aren't shadow clones (such a Rock or Water Clones), X is considered to be 1; X cannot go above without using actual Shadow Clones.  
Attempting to parry Crescent Moon Dance requires the defender to roll 2d20.takeLowest(1) in place of 1d20. Ninjutsu-based defenses do not suffer from this limitation.  
Crescent Moon Dance cannot benefit from Iaijutsu (or, as a result, Flash Blade), and the wounds it deals are reduced by one category.  
Crescent Moon Dance may not have its Speed reduced below its Delay.

### **Kadou Kikan \- Vortex Engine**

Spinning their fan like a staff user would, this doesn't create an impenetrable defense, instead the fan is twisted to use all that force to create massive wind gusts.

Stamina: 45  
Upkeep: 12  
Damage: (Weapon's damage) \*4  
Speed: 16  
Range: CHA/6  
Requires: Fan

Effects:  
When this technique is activated, everyone in front of you, in a tunnel-shaped space ten yards wide, can choose to either take damage from this technique. or be knocked back CHA/6 yards. This requires no Accuracy; it cannot be dodged, or parried by ninjutsu. Defenses which work without a roll (such as Earth Shore Return) do function against it.  
This effect occurs again every 5 IC so long as you maintain the Upkeep. Each time after the first, the divisor on your CHA for the range (but not the distance knocked back) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of CHA/1, 25 IC after you begin Vortex Engine), and the Speed is considered 1 higher for the purposes of determining damage.  
While this technique's Upkeep is maintained you may take no other actions, including Interrupts. The Stamina cost is paid only way in it's initially activated. If you use AP to reduce the Speed of the initial activation, the Speed of the damage dealt every 5 IC afterwards is similarly reduced.

### **Sanjuu Hayate \- Three-fold Gale**

With this technique, three shots are fired in rapid succession. With each arrow fired, the archer takes note of the effects of drag and wind speed, as well as their opponent's reaction, and compensates before launching the next arrow. In addition to requiring an incredible degree of focus, this technique is quite taxing to perform.

Stamina: As Weapon \*3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon+15  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
This attack consists of three separate shots. When you attack make three Accuracy rolls, the first as normal, the second with a \+2 bonus, and the third with a \+4 bonus. The opponent makes a single defense against this attack, unless they're parrying (not including ninjutsu-based defenses), in which case they must defend against each one with a separate parry roll and action.  
Each arrow multiplies your damage bonus by half of  
Sanjuu Hayate's Speed, but rolls its full amount of dice. The damage of these shots is combined when damage reduction is applied and to determine wounds inflicted.  
If you have aimed your bow ahead of time (taking an Aim action, as described in the bows themselves), that Accuracy bonus applies only to the first of Threefold Gale's rolls.
