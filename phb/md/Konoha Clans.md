## **Aburame**

The Aburame are one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure, and are among the most reclusive and aloof. They are distinguishable by their distinctive fashion; most choose to cover the majority of their body with long, loose clothing and dark glasses that hide their eyes; duster coats and round glasses are popular choices. Aburame tend to be soft-spoken and matter of fact, and rarely deal in 'small talk' or social pleasantries.

Their solitude is rightly attributed to their kekkei genkai; from a young age, every clan member is made host to a hive of insects called Kikaichuu, a special type of beetle that feasts on chakra. The Aburame's body becomes a nest for these bugs, who flourish and grow alongside their host. Eventually, this symbiotic relationship allows the Aburame to mentally control and direct their personal swarm; it is this deep unity that makes their kekkei genkai so powerful, and so unsettling.

Shortly after a member of the Aburame Clan is born they have their body sacrificed to the bugs. From that moment on, their flesh is host to thousands upon thousands of insects called Kikaichu. This is due to the family's sacred and ancient forbidden jutsu, not poor hygiene.

The Aburame have formed a symbiotic bond with their Kikaichu. The insects gain easy access to food from the host's chakra; and shelter inside the host's body. In return, the insects obey the Aburame's commands and serve as a potent ally.

**Aburame start with 1 less Unique Point and Kikaichu no Jutsu at no cost, ignoring the requirements**.

 

### **Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique \- Kikaichu no Jutsu**

Aburame have thousands of insect allies called Kikaichu living inside their body. Type:

Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Cost: None  
Range: CHA/10  
Area: Up to CHA/10  
Speed: 12

Effect:

You create a cloud of Kikaichu. Anyone who is in the Swarm's Area must, at the Aburame's discretion, make a TN 15 Chakra Roll every 10 IC they remain in the Swarm. Being in the area of multiple swarms does not cause the Chakra tests to happen any faster. The Swarm has CHA\*6 Vitality. It ignores damage not caused by an Area of Effect attack, as well as all non-damaging effects of attacks except for Ignite and Knockback (whether it came from an Area of Effect or not). Damage, Ignite, and Knockback the Swarm suffers is halved unless it came from a source whose Area of Effect encompassed the entire Swarm. The Swarm uses its own Vitality and all other traits based on its Host. If Swarm would logically be pushed in multiple directions (such as Wind God's Breath while inside the Swarm) then the user of that effect chooses the direction. At 0 Vitality the Swarm disperses, this Jutsu ends, and this Jutsu may not be used again until the Swarm recovers some Vitality. The Swarm may not be removed by effects that remove environmental effects, such as Wind God’s Breath.

Kikaichu may be communicated with out to a range of CHA/5 yards through minor fluctuations in the Host's Chakra. Kikaichu can operate beyond that range, and are surprisingly intelligent; but they may not receive new orders and will die after 24 Hours away from their Host. Kikaichu always know the distance and direction to their Host. Bunshin, even Kage Bunshin, may not use this Jutsu. Only one Swarm can exist at a time. The Swarm's Vitality persists between uses, and heals at a rate of CHA every hour out of combat.

Aburame gain access to the following actions to utilize their Kikaichu:

*\[Speed* *4 or \+4\] Return* \- If the Swarm is within CHA/5 Yards, it re-enters the Aburame's body and this Jutsu may be used again at a later time. This can be used against an attack, in which case it modifies the Speed of the Aburame's defense. Used that way, the Swarm benefits from that Defense. After the Defense is resolved, whether it succeeds or fails, the Swarm returns to the Aburame's body. Upon returning to the Aburame's body, any actions that modify the Swarm end and any Ignite affecting the Swarm end.

*\[AP X or Speed X\] Move \-* The Swarm Moves up to CHA/30 Yards every IC for the next X IC. The swarm can slip through tiny cracks and fly.

### **Kikaichu Trainer**

In the beginning, the Aburame’s relationship with their Kikaichu is one of the Host tapping into the Kikaichu’s natural instinct: follow chakra, sate your hunger, protect your home. Through discipline, an Aburame can train their Kikaichu to perform more nuanced actions.

Cost: 15  
Limit: 1  
Effects:

The Aburame may now use their bugs to make skill checks through their Kikaichu at range. The normal rules for communicating with Kikaichu and how long they can survive apart from the Host apply. Although the duration is increased to a week. Storytellers may apply a penalty of up to \-10 on checks Kikaichu are ill suited for, or even disallow checks that Kikaichu simply could not do. The Aburame still performs any relevant actions and pays any associated cost. Many Aburame make Awareness, Stealth and/or Survival checks to spy, sneak a bug in, or track people. This does not meaningfully deplete the Aburame's Swarm, and Kikaichu no Jutsu does not need to be active to do this. A single Kikaichu can be trivially crushed by anyone who spots it.

### **Crouching Mantis, Hidden Centipede**

Discipline has evolved into ingenuity. Your Kikaichu are capable of more subtle approaches.  
Cost: 20  
Limit: 1  
Requires: Kikaichu Training

Effects:  
The Aburame’s Kikaichu Swarm is now considered a separate character for the purposes of Stealth. Clan Ninjutsu no longer end the Aburame’s Stealth, but will end the Swarm’s. If the Aburame is in Stealth when they use Kikaichu no Jutsu, the Swarm is created with the same Stealth TN. If the Swarm triggers a Chakra roll, its Stealth ends. The Aburame may have Hide and Improve Hiding affect their Swarm instead of themselves.
Additionally, the Aburame gets access to the following actions: 

[Speed \+10, Delay 10] Secrete Bugs - This action modifies Kikaichu no Jutsu while the Aburame is not in Stealth. The Swarm is created in Stealth 2.  
[Speed 0 Interrupt] Wait - You may declare a Kikaichu Swarm in Stealth is waiting. While waiting, the Kikaichu Swarm passively and discretely crawls on opponents, waiting to bite all at once. While the Swarm remains in stealth it adds 1 Female Insect every 25 IC (10 Minutes out of Combat). Out of combat, this increases Bugs to a maximum of 10. Out of combat this prompts an Awareness roll from anyone who gets Bugs.

### **Hijutsu: Mushiyose \- Secret Technique: Bug Gathering**

By simply touching a surface with their palm and fingers, the user releases a small web of chakra that draws bugs to that location and allows the Aburame to communicate with them.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E  
Chakra: 10  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 12

Effect:   
This grants the Aburame a \+5 bonus on relevant Survival, Awareness, and Research rolls, or \+20 when the roll directly relates to finding or understanding insects. The Aburame may be able to get information not normally available, but there is no guarantee a bug's perspective will be useful.

### **Hijutsu: Konchū no Bōdō \- Hidden Technique: Insect Insurrection**

By instinct, Kikaichu adopt greedy and highly aggressive tactics against opponents. When a threat to the hive is detected, they swarm and drain as much Chakra as possible, gorging themselves and either warding off the predator or killing them. Trained and focused Aburame can use the chaos of battle to allow some bugs to nest themselves on or in an opponent.  

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank E  
Speed: \+2  
Delay: 5  
Tags: Link  

Effects:    
This add-on modifies any jutsu with the attack tag increasing to Speed 5 if the jutsu has an Area. If the attack hits, the Aburame places a female insect on the opponent after the delay ends. They are hidden with a Stealth TN of 25 \+ your stealth bonus. This isn't affected by and doesn’t contribute to the penalties for attempting Stealth multiple times per combat. If the person with the Bugs spots them, they may remove them with a Speed 5 action increased by 1 per every extra female insect currently on them.  

### **Hijutsu: Kikaichu Mushikui \- Hidden Technique: Destruction Bug Bite**

Your Kikaichu smarm an individual target, tearing away a chunk of their Chakra and leaving unpleasant bites.  

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 15  
Area: As Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique - Kikaichu no Jutsu  
Speed: 8  
Accuracy: \+X\/4  
Tags: Attack, Self  

Effects:  
X is the number of female insects on a target. The target must make a Chakra 8 \+ X \* 3 (To a max of 10 \+ your Chakra Control) roll and take irreducible damage equal to triple the chakra cost. This damage is tripled again if the target fails the chakra roll. Any female insects on the target increase their Stealth Level by 1 to a max of 3.  

### **Hijutsu: Mushidama \- Hidden Technique: Bug Sphere**

The user sends their kikaichū to spread over a wide range, and the moment they locate the target, the insects gather at once, forming a sphere around the target. Even if the target manages to escape, the insects will immediately follow.  

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 24  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 16  
Accuracy: \+X\/3  
Effect:  
X is the number of female insects on a target. Target one person inside your Swarm but calculate their Dodge penalties based on the Swarm’s area. If it hits, the Swarm surrounds the target (losing its Area) and cannot be used for anything besides Hijutsu: Kikaichu Mushikui - Hidden Technique: Destruction Bug Bite targeting only the one surrounded. While in the Swarm, the opponent gains a -2 Immobilization penalty. Every 10 IC spent in the Swarm applies another female insect to the target. If the opponent moves, the Swarm will automatically chase them at a rate of CHA/30 Yards per IC.  

You may end this jutsu with a Return action either reverting the swarm back to normal or returning them to your body as usual.  

### **Mushi Bunshin no Jutsu \- Bug Clone Technique**

An Aburame has thousands of their kikaichū gather together until they've taken on the size and appearance of the Aburame, to be used either as a decoy or a diversion. The insect clone can be created anywhere that the kikaichū are positioned or sent to.  

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 15 \+ 4\*X  
Upkeep: X  
Speed: 14 \+ X  
Seal Speed: 6 \+ 3\*X

Requires: Kikaichu no Jutsu active

Effect:  
Create X Clones, to a maximum of 3. The Clones occupy anywhere in the Swarm, with swirling bug Swarms shifting their position. You don't need to track the clone's exact position and they are immune to area of effect attacks. While this Jutsu is maintained, using the Hide Among Clones action restores all Mushi Bunshin for free and the Area of your swarm is reduced by 20\% per clone. If the Swarm is destroyed, this Jutsu ends.

The Clones have the Aburame's Stats as though they were Fatigue 1. If they advance a Fatigue level, they are destroyed. Clones are created with copies of the items the user had, except for consumables, chakra-infused items, electronic items, and items with complex moving parts. 

While one or more Clones are active, the Aburame gain access to the following actions:  
[Variable AP] Attack: The Clone performs a Basic Unarmed Attack, Basic Weapon Attack, a Dual Weapon Attack, or a Multi-Throw. The attack can use any Weapons the Clone has and the attack is modified by Insect Insurrection. This costs half of the total Speed in AP, instead of Insect Insurrection's regular AP cost. Use the Aburame's CHA in place of their STR and Ninjutsu DB in place of their Physical DB. This attack is considered to be Held Back. The Clones can only target someone else who is inside of the Swarm.  
[1 AP] Defend - The clone may Dodge or Parry (using any weapon it has or no weapon) any attack aimed at it. This will not defend the Swarm, but it may prevent the clone from becoming dispersed.  
[Speed 10] Masquerade - With the Aburame’s direct help and guidance, the Swarm condenses down fully into a perfectly you-shaped area or returns to its normal shape. While you-shaped, it gains a \+5 bonus on any rolls to convince other people that it is you. This action can only be used if there is only one clone.  

### **Mushi Kame no Jutsu \- Bug Jar Technique**

A technique capable of protecting against attacks by using kikaichū to fly in a dome shape at high speed. While proving defensive, a sufficient amount of explosive force can break through it.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Speed: Variable  
Requires: Kikaichu no Jutsu active  

Effect:  
This is a variable Speed defensive action action declared like a Block. You may declare another variable speed defensive action alongside Bug Jar such as Block, Guard, Full Defense, Defensive Formation, et cetera. While active, the Aburame and any of their allies inside the Swarm may choose to let the swarm defend them when attacked. If they do, they may not apply another defense, but damage is subtracted from the Swarm’s Vitality before the protected person. Attacks that have their damage completely prevented are not considered to have hit their target. Bug Jar will stop non-damaging attacks that need to hit, but it will not stop Genjutsu.

**Advanced Host**

You have specialized in one or more of the Aburame’s more unique bug specimens.  
Cost: 50  
Requires: The ability to learn B-Rank General Ninjutsu.

Effects:

Select one of the following special insect types to specialize in per rank. You may spend a Talent to select another type of insect. In all cases, X is equal to the opponent’s Bugs.

*Kikaichu:* You carry an additional pouch or gourd with its own swarm of Kikaichu. This Swarm has its own Vitality and may be released by using Kikaichu no Jutsu, even if another Swarm is in existence. Jutsu that affect the Swarm may only affect one Swarm at a time.

*Shokaichu:* These insects are small burrowing worms that are highly sensitive to Chakra. The Aburame gains a Speed 12 "Plant Shokaichu" action that places one Shokaichu at their location in Stealth 3\. This isn't affected by and doesn’t contribute to the penalties for attempting Stealth multiple times per combat. The Aburame may have up to three Shokaichu active at a time. Shokaichu have 1 Hit Point and are immune to area of effect attacks. Shokaichu act as relays, able to facilitate communication between Aburame, Shokaichu, and Kikaichu within CHA yards (even chaining several Shokaichu together). Shokaichu can also detect Chakra within that area, and allow an Aburame communicating with one to ignore Visibility Penalties to Awareness rolls against people within CHA yards of the Shokaichu.

*Kochu:* These insects eat poison, greatly improving how quickly it is metabolized in the Aburame’s system. Poison lasts only half of its regular duration on the Aburame, and any allies treat each IC spent in the swarm as 2 IC against the poison's duration. By increasing Kikaichu Mushikui’s Speed by 5, they Aburame may apply Kochu venom instead of its regular effects. The poison has the following traits: Poison 2, Paralysis X/5, Duration 20\. IC spent in the Swarm do not count against this Poison's Duration. Use XP/200+X/5 instead of your Toxicology ranks.

*Rinkaichu:* Rinkaichu are specialized nano sized insects that consume flesh on the cellular level and multiply. Unfortunately, Rinkaichu destroys any Kikaichu in the host's body. Your Swarm and Bug Bite no longer force Chakra Rolls. People inside the swarm take (5+X/2)% of their current Vitality \+ HP in unreducible damage every 10 IC they remain inside the Swarm and when hit with Kikaichu Mushikui. Your unarmed attacks inflict Energy Wounds, and if they aren’t affected by partial defense they inflict Ignite X/2, representing the bugs.

*Kidaichu:* Kidaichu are mixed in with the regular swarm. These microscopic insects burrow underneath the skin and then, when fed an improper mix of chakra, grow suddenly to enormous size. When taking an action to reveal Bugs on someone, inflict X/5 Piercing Wounds (rounding up) on them. Each time you roll the same location, increase the severity of the Wound by 1 instead of applying an additional wound.

## **Akimichi**

One of the four noble clans of Leaf, the Akimichi do not come off as particularly detached from, or superior to, others--none of the noble clans do (well, perhaps the Hyuuga), but the Akimichi in particular are, at least as a general rule, gregarious and altruistic. The typical Akimichi is of below-average height and stockily built. Some are overweight, others husky or muscular. This is partly genetics, and partly the result of the unique jutsu they possess, which allows them to manipulate their physical structure and rapidly convert calories directly into chakra.

A tradition within the Akimichi clan, though by no means an enforced one, is for the shinobi members to place some manner of design on their cheeks in face paint, chosen after they become genin. Some change it upon rising in ranks, while others go the opposite direction and opt to get it tattooed on. Common examples are spirals, triangle designs, and concentric circles.

Since before Konoha was founded the Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clans have collaborated closely with one another, and most Akimichi will unreservedly let their loyalty to their compatriots be known.

**Akimichi begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

### **Calorie Conversion**

Akimichi can convert excess calories to chakra. This can be used for just about anything that requires chakra, though it's most efficient when combined with their clan's techniques. Overuse of this ability results in them literally eating away at their own body; once all the fat stores have been used, muscles and organ tissue is converted next.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 1  
Scale: 1  
Limit: RES / 10

Effects:  
Each time you take this ability you gain 1 Calorie Point (CP). CP is assigned when using Clan Jutsu or to pay for the Upkeep of Jutsu without incurring in the normal penalties for doing so. This does not mean that they do not count as having an Upkeep if they lower one to 0, an Upkeep of 0 is still an Upkeep. Any time an Akimichi uses a Jutsu with an Upkeep, they can decide how much of their CP they are dedicating to maintaining it, this CP cannot be allocated anywhere else until that jutsu ends. For non-clan jutsu, you need to assign 3 CP to reduce the upkeep by1. Akimichi can go into negative CP when assigning CP to Upkeeps, but while their CP is below 0 they suffer from a Poison effect of the same severity (-1 CP would be Poison 1, \-2 CP would be Poison 2, etc). This cannot be mitigated by any means other than bringing their CPs back to 0 or more.

### **Akimichi Energy Bars**

Tasty, individually-wrapped energy bars which come in dozens of flavors, including peanut butter, chocolate chip, blackberry, celery, and milk. They're packed full of calories and simple-carbohydrates, and Akimichi are able to metabolize them almost instantly.

Type: Item  
Cost: 20 Ryo each

Effects:  
Eating a bar is a Speed 4 action that raises the CP limit of the Akimichi by 1 for 50 IC. Eating multiple bars stack up to a maximum of 3\. If a bar is still active when another one is consumed, its effects are stretched until the last bar consumed ends.

### **Baika no Jutsu \- Multi-Size Technique**

The primary jutsu of the Akimichi clan, this increases the user's body size drastically; due to the extreme amounts of chakra necessary to cause such drastic growth, it's usually powered by the clan's calorie control techniques.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 15 \+ X/2  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 10

Effects:  
You subtract X points from your AGI, and add X to your STR and RES. You can't reduce your AGI below half its maximum value using this technique. You can only activate this jutsu if you have enough CP free to reduce its Upkeep to 0, which you must do in order to maintain it. You cannot go into negative CP to activate this jutsu. The modified stats do not count against Ability prerequisites. The following effects apply during Baika no Jutsu:

* All your unarmed attacks gain Area X/10, or have their existing Area increased by that amount.  
* You gain a damage reduction of X/2.  
* You have a \-X/2 penalty to Stealth rolls.  
* You reduce the severity of any Stuns inflicted upon you by X/10, and any effects which would move you involuntarily will move you X/3 fewer yards.  
* Your Taijutsu attacks have a reach of \+1 yards.

Adjusting the value of X while this jutsu is active is a Spd 10 action with a Chakra cost of 10+Y/2, where Y is the difference between X and X’s new value. (i.e. if you use Baika no Jutsu at X=10 and then you want to readjust at X=30, the initial cost would be 15+10/2=20 and the adjustment cost would be 10+(30-10)/2=20, if you had cast Baika no Jutsu at X=30 from the start, it would have cost 15+30/2=30 instead).

Baika no Jutsu’s attribute change interactions:  
Maximum Vitality and HP are affected (this affects Wound thresholds).  
Current Vitality and HP are not affected (If you somehow gain these above your new maximum, excess is lost when modifying stats).  
Maximum and Current AP are calculated off the unmodified AGI.  
Current and Maximum Willpower are not affected  
Damage bonuses are calculated using modified attributes  
Accuracy and Defense bonuses are calculated using modified attributes  
Bonuses to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls are calculated using modified attributes  
Movement is calculated using modified attributes (unless specified otherwise)

### **Nikudan Sensha \- Human Bullet Tank**

After enlarging with the multi-size technique, the Akimichi tucks their limbs in and uses chakra to propel themselves in a powerful roll across the ground.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 6  
Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu active

Effects:  
When you activate this jutsu you are considered to be rolling in place. You must reduce this technique’s Upkeep to 0 using CP in order to maintain it, but you can go into negative CP to do so.While this Jutsu is active, the following characteristics which apply to you:

* You are considered to be always Blocking  
* You can use the Dodge action.  
* You cannot use the Parry action.  
* You cannot use any jutsu that requires handseals.  
* You have a \-5 penalty to Awareness.  
* You cannot grapple and your break Clinch, Break Grapple, and Escape Grapple actions all get a \+10 bonus.  
* You ignore Immobilization penalties of less than 10\. If you are ever affected by an immobilization penalty of 10 or more, this technique ends automatically.  
* You can Move using your AGI unmodified by any wounds, jutsu or effects to calculate distance moved.  
* You cannot use any Taijutsu except for the following:

### **Rolling Crush**

Type: Taijutsu, Rank D  
Stm: 15  
Damage: (STR/10)d8  
Area: X  
Speed: 15  
Requires: Nikudan Sensha active

Effect:  
You roll forward in a line until you smash into a target or an obstacle, crushing it with your massive weight enhanced by the rotational force of your charge. You may move up to the full speed of this attack (instead of half as normal). This attack hits all targets (enemies or friends) in an Area equal to the Area of your unarmed attacks while in Baika or Cho Baika no Jutsu (whichever you are maintaining). If you move at least 5 yards in the same direction while attacking, your Damage Bonus for this attack is doubled. Unarmed Parries (or weapon parries if they can somehow parry unarmed taijutsu) have a \-3 Penalty against this attack, or a \-5 penalty if you moved at least 5 yards towards your target before reaching it.

### **Nikudan Hari Sensha \- Spiked Human Bullet Tank**

The Akimichi attaches dozens of kunai to multiple lengths of wire which they then drape loosely around their body. When they increase in size the wires become taut, and the kunai form rings of spikes around their body. While this is certainly effective as a means of attack, the real purpose is much simpler: the kunai function like cleats, aiding in turning.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 30  
Upkeep 4  
Speed: 6  
Requires: Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu active

Effects:  
Using Nikudan Hari Sensha requires at least 30 specially prepared kunai, which may be used repeatedly for this technique. Repurposing them as regular throwing weapons (i.e. removing them from their wire) does mean they can no longer be used for this.This functions the same as Nikudan Sensha, with the following exceptions:

Anyone hitting you with an unarmed attack, suffers Piercing damage equal to your current DR. If you Block a Weapon, you block 50% of the damage (instead of the normal 25%). You cannot use any Taijutsu except for the following:

### **Rolling Spiked Crush**

Type: Weapon Taijutsu, Rank C  
Stm: 20  
Damage: (STR/10)d10  
Speed: 15  
Requires: Nikudan Hari Sensha active

Effect: You roll forward in a line until you smash into a target or an obstacle, crushing it with your massive weight enhanced by the rotational force of your charge and the spiked barbs of the kunai wrapped around you. You may move up to the full speed of this attack (instead of half as normal). This attack hits all targets (enemies or friends) in an Area equal to the Area of your unarmed attacks while in Baika or Cho Baika no Jutsu (whichever you are maintaining). If you move at least 5 yards in the same direction while attacking, your Damage Bonus for this attack is doubled. This attack causes Piercing Wounds. Weapon Parries (or unarmed parries if they can somehow parry weapon taijutsu) have a \-3 Penalty against this attack, or a \-5 penalty if you moved at least 5 yards towards your target before reaching it.

### **Bubun Baika no Jutsu \- Partial Multi-Size Technique**

A more situational variation upon the multi-size technique, this temporarily enlarges only a single part of the body. Most commonly the arms are chosen, for the sake of a quick offense, but legs are equally viable.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 5 \+ X/4  
Speed: \+2

Effects:  
This supplements another action (typically a taijutsu attack). For the duration of that action you gain \+X STR, to a maximum of double your normal STR. You cannot use this while Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu are active. If it ever becomes relevant what this STR affects or not, use Baika no Jutsu’s guidelines for attribute interactions.

### **Cho Baika no Jutsu \- Super Multi-Size Technique**

Essentially a scaled-up version of the Akimichi's regular multi-size technique, this increases the user (and their clothing) to gigantic proportions; even the weakest users will be as tall as a building, and with enough energy invested this can let someone easily tower over most trees.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 20 \+ X/2  
Upkeep: 10  
Speed: 15

Effects:  
X is the difference between your current AGI, and what your AGI will become in Cho Baika no Jutsu. (Such that if you are already in Baika no Jutsu, you Agi won't be reduced as much, and thus X will be lower) If used when already in Baika no Jutsu, this temporarily replaces that technique's effects, and Cho Baika's cost is reduced by 10 and its Speed to 5\. You can only activate this jutsu if you have enough CP free to reduce its Upkeep to 0, which you must do in order to maintain it. You cannot go into negative CP to activate this jutsu, but if you were maintaining Baika no Jutsu, the CP used in that technique can be moved to this one instead (so if you were using Baika no Jutsu, you would only need 7 free CP to use Cho Baika no Jutsu).

When active, the following effects are applied:

* Your Unmodified Stats (Stats before any such modifiers from other Jutsu) are adjusted as follows: AGI is reduced by 50% and your STR and RES are increased by 100% of their normal values.  
* All your unarmed attacks gain Area X/5, or have their existing Area increased by that amount.  
* You gain a damage reduction of X.  
* You cannot Hide.  
* You reduce the severity of any Stuns inflicted upon you by X/5, and any effects which would move you involuntarily will move you X/2 fewer yards.  
* Your Taijutsu attacks have a reach of \+5 yards.  
* Your physical damage bonus is calculated as STR/12.  
* Your AGI for the purposes of movement speed is calculated without including the penalty from Cho Baika no Jutsu.  
* You can grapple someone using only a single hand. This does allow you to, potentially, hold one person in each hand.  
* You are immune to any environmental effect with an area of X/5 or less

Cho Baika no Jutsu’s attribute change interactions:  
Maximum Vitality and HP are affected (this affects Wound thresholds).  
Current Vitality and HP are not affected (If you somehow gain these above your new maximum, excess is lost when modifying stats).  
Maximum and Current AP are calculated off the unmodified AGI.  
Current and Maximum Willpower are not affected  
Damage bonuses are calculated using modified attributes  
Accuracy and Defense bonuses are calculated using modified attributes  
Bonuses to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls are calculated using modified attributes  
Movement is calculated using modified attributes (unless specified otherwise)

### **Chodan Bakugeki \- Butterfly Bullet Bombing**

This technique is typically only usable after an Akimichi has consumed a red food pill, due to its extreme chakra requirements; in fact, that's where it got its name. The amount of chakra produced from consuming a red pill is so excessive that the Akimichi's body has to vent it off, resulting in visible plumes of chakra bursting from their shoulder blades in a display reminiscent of butterfly wings.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: Special  
Damage: (STR/5+RES/5+X)d20  
Speed: 25  
Area: X\*2

Effects:  
Using this technique requires you to have at least 15 CP available. X is the amount of CP you are willing to commit to this technique. CP spent on this jutsu is gone for the remainder of the fight. This technique has no cost but you must commit at least 15 CP into it. This adds your physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses together to determine its damage bonus. The primary target takes full damage; anyone else caught in the area takes half of that damage (they defend normally against this attack). This jutsu cannot be used while maintaining Baika no Jutsu or Cho Baika no Jutsu, but Bubun Baika no Jutsu can be used with it.

### **Sanshoku no Gan'yaku \- Three-Colored Pills**

A secret medicine developed and used exclusively by the Akimichi clan, these three pills convert stored energy into chakra to give the user a tremendous boost in power. Understandably, these are exceptionally potent in the hands of an Akimichi. Even so, there's a good reason they're not widely used. They're not gentle on the body, and the chemicals released by the pills in the process are actually toxic. Despite their names, they don't taste like food. They taste like... well, poison.

Eating a pill is a Speed 4 action and it costs 1 Willpower Point. Eating a pill applies a Poison effect as described in its entry, this effect cannot be mitigated by any means and the benefits from the pill apply for as long as this effect is in place (if the poison is somehow cut short, so are the benefits). So long as the pills are in effect, you will not fall unconscious from loss of HP (you can still lose consciousness due to Fatigue). You can fight even at negative HP for as long as one of these pills is in effect, the moment the last pill ends, you will suffer the normal consequences for the state of your HP, however. Anyone other than an Akimichi who takes these pills suffers a Poison effect for a duration as listed in the pill but receives none of the benefits. When a pill's effects expire, you can let it end or take a higher-strength pill as a non-action. If you let a pill expire, you cannot take another pill until you have recovered from the negative effects of the last pill you took. You can also take a pill before the previous one expires as Speed 4 action. If you do, the effects of the previous pill stop entirely and you begin applying the new ones (you do not advance Fatigue levels until you let a pill expire). Once you let a pill expire, your maximum CP is set to 0 until your Fatigue level is reduced to 0 (you cannot go into negative CP during this time either). Akimichi are issued only one of each pill at a time. Giving these pills away is treason, and it's a credit to the clan that to date no Akimichi has done so.

#### **Hourengan \- Green Spinach Pill**

Your maximum CP is increased by 5  
You are immune to Knockback  
When you take this pill your Chakra Exhaustion penalty is reset to 0\.  
You have \+2 Acc and \+2 to all your defenses (in case of parry you only apply the bonus once)  
Poison: 3,Duration: 50, When the pill expires, your Fatigue advances 1 level.

#### **Karengan \- Yellow Curry Pill**

Your maximum CP is increased by 10  
You are immune to Knockback and Stuns  
When you take this pill your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties are reset to 0  
You have \+3 Acc and \+3 to all your defenses (in case of parry you only apply the bonus once)  
Poison: 5,Duration: 100, When the pill expires, your Fatigue advances 2 levels.

#### **Tongarashigan \- Red Chilli Pill**

Your maximum CP is increased by 20  
You are immune to Knockback, Stuns, Immobilization and Paralysis  
When you take this pill your Chakra Exhaustion and Stamina penalties are reset to 0 and your Fatigue level is reduced by 2\.  
You have \+5 Acc and \+5 to all your defenses (in case of parry you only apply the bonus once)  
Poison: 10,Duration: 100, When the pill expires, your Fatigue advances 8 levels.

**NOTE:** As you may notice, it's quite easy to go above "Fatigue 6", which is to say, unconsciousness, by using these pills. Pushing your body that far is dangerous, and hard to recover from. For every Fatigue category you are beyond unconscious (i.e. Fatigue 8 would be 2 over), one Fatigue level takes an entire week to heal. For example, if you were at Fatigue 9, you would be (7, 8, 9\) 3 levels above unconscious. This means that once you woke up, it would take a week to recover from Fatigue 5, another week to recover from Fatigue 4, another week to recover from Fatigue 3, and you'd then recover normally.

## **Inuzuka**

Like the ninken (ninja dogs) they fight alongside, the Inuzuka are both highly spirited and very loyal \-- to the good of Konohagakure and to their individual friends. Despite being one of the smaller clans in Konoha, their presence has long been valued by the village as a whole.

For decades they have contributed to the strength of Konoha's scouting and tracking units, aided greatly by their ninken. Inuzuka medics often double as veterinarians, and many retire to work as vets or breeders once they've finished serving as proper ninja. Most Inuzuka, even if not permanently assigned to tracking squads, will be temporarily 'borrowed' to assist with missions where their skills will come in handy at some point in their career.

Physically, Inuzuka tend to be easily identifiable by the traditional red markings on their cheeks and slightly more fang-like canines. An Inuzuka is very rarely seen far from his or her ninken, even from childhood years. An Inuzuka's dog is a friend, playmate, and ally in battle. Inuzuka train with their ninken starting even before their academy years, ultimately culminating in some of Konoha's most physically destructive taijutsu.

The Inuzuka are often characterized as blunt and rough around the edges, taking things from playful to what most others would consider hurtful. Nonetheless, they're very protective of their teammates and typically mean well.

**Inuzuka start with 1 less Unique Point.**

### **Ninken**

Your ninken, or ninja dog, is more than just an extra weapon in combat; it's a living creature with its own capabilities. However, its advancement is inextricably tied to your own as the two of you do all your training together.

Your Ninken has the same stats that you have in everything besides AP, WP, speed and PDB. You and your Ninken share a pool for your AP and WP but your Ninken has only 50% of your PDB and Vitality. They are always a bit faster than you, having 125% your base movement.

* Basic Attack: Speed 8, (AGI/6)d6  
* Grab: Same as an E-rank Grapple  
* Grapple jutsu that you know up to D rank. (it has only one limb for it).  
* Stealth: Your Ninken hides\! This is the same speed as a normal hide action, and has all the same requirements.  
* Ninken are assumed to pass all stamina checks they have to make, but will advance in fatigue when you do (They’re empathetic like that), they don’t track a vitality pool, but if they’re hit by an attack they calculate what kind of wound they would take based on their Max Vitality   
* Dodge, parry, block, But it can’t TTH normally. (as the owner of the Ninken you roll 2d20 take higher when trying to take the hit for your ninken)

They don’t take wounds, but they receive a stun based on the rank of the wound they would have taken.

* Minor \= 10 IC  
* Major \= 30 IC  
* Severe \= 50 IC  
* Critical \= Knocked out for the rest of combat.

### **Bestial Teamwork**

Ninken are thoroughly trained and impeccably bred, they’re smarter, stronger, faster, and more biologically gifted than any other species of dog you could find anyplace else. This is in large part due to selective breeding making them more impressionable to the chakra of the Inuzuka, and through spending all their time together, the chakra of the Inuzuka will over the course of the Ninken’s life start to increase its gifts even further.

Out of combat your ninken is assumed to have ranks and bonuses in the following skills equal to yours and anytime you make a skill roll with the associated skill, your ninken also makes a roll:

* Athletics  
* Awareness  
* Resistance  
* Stealth  
* Survival

In addition to this, every 400 XP you can select one of the following effects to apply to your Ninken:

Good Nose:  
Your Ninken gains \+3 to awareness checks, and \+1 to Survival checks

Sneaky:  
Your Niken gains \+3 to stealth checks and \+1 to Survival checks

Hardy:  
Your Ninken gains \+3 to resistance checks and \+1 to Survival checks

Energetic:  
Your Ninken gains \+3 to athletics checks and \+1 to Survival checks

Tracker Hound  
Your Ninken gains \+4 to survival checks.

You can take each of these multiple times, but each one only up to a cap of (XP/1000).

### **Shikyaku no Jutsu \- Four Legs Technique**

Using this technique, the user takes on much more animalistic mannerisms, hunching down to all-fours and baring his teeth, for example. Even his physical characteristics become more animal-like: canines and fingernails grow into fangs and claws, pupils become slitted rather than rounded. More importantly, the user's reflexes, senses, speed and strength rise in power dramatically. The Inuzuka often utilize this technique to launch effective hit-and-run offenses against an opponent.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank D  
Chakra: 5  
Upkeep: 1  
Speed: 5

Effects:  
Your AGI counts 25% higher for purposes of movement while you are using this, you may not use ninjutsu or hold weapons (even in your teeth). All Taijutsu attacks deal slashing damage and increase their wounding by 25%. Any benefits your Ninken gains from “Beastial Teamwork” you gain also, and if anyone enters stealth within AGI yards of you whilst this is active, you get an immediate awareness roll vs their Stealth TN. Ninjutsu and genjutsu effects which you had used prior and are still in effect, remain in effect.

### **Tsuga \- Passing Fang**

The user spins his body at incredible speeds, the surrounding chakra and air creating the appearance of a long vortex rotating along its axis. The user in this state then rushes to make direct contact with the victim. It can be extremely damaging, as it is capable of ripping through great tree trunks or chakra-reinforced earth barriers.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank D  
Stamina: 10 \+ Special  
Damage: (STR /6)d10  
Speed: 10  
Special: Opener

Effects:  
This move is melee, but when calculating how far you can move as part of an attack involving this move, you can add up to (AGI/2) yards to how far it moves, but doing so increases the stamina cost of this move by (That amount/5). You do not include the yards you would have moved anyway as part of this attack when calculating how much extra Stamina you have to pay on this move.

This attack’s damage is increased by 1% for every 2 yards you traveled as part of this jutsu. Additionally, unlike normal attacks, you don’t have to stop at your opponent and can continue moving using any remaining movement past your opponent.

Opener:  
The effects of partial hits on your combo attacks in combos where this is the opener are reduced by 10% per combo counter. So, if you had gotten a 40% partial hit, but you had one rank of cadence, you would be 60% damage. At Combo Counter 5, you do full damage even if you hit by just 1 point. In addition to this, combo jutsu, if used alongside your Ninken in Jujin Bunshin, gain the effect that if either you or your Ninken hit your opponent with an attack, whoever rolled the lowest between you gets a bonus to their ACC equal to your cadence rank.

### **Jujin Bunshin \- Beast Human Clone**

Derived from the basic Henge, this technique transforms the ninken into the likeness of its owner, though the ninken will still behave like an animal in this form. However, together with the Shikyaku no Jutsu, the two become virtually indistinguishable. Gatsuga often follows quickly upon use of this technique. This technique also shares the same basic weaknesses of Henge.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 15  
Speed: 12  
Upkeep: 5

Effects:  
You must have “Shikyaku No Jutsu \- Four Legs Technique” activated in order to use this Ninjutsu, and your ninken must not be stunned when this is activated.

This technique changes your Ninken into a lookalike of you, your ninken stops acting on its own IC and stops being tracked in initiative all together, falling in quickly beside you as he joins you in a coordinated offensive alongside you.  
Under the effect of Jujin Bunshin both you and your Ninken instead of adding 10 to your ACC bonuses to calculate ACC, instead roll 1d20+Normal ACC bonuses to calculate ACC, taking a \-2 penalty to all of these rolls. You are also always considered hidden with your Ninken as per Clone Technique.

Any time you use any unarmed basic attack or unarmed Taijutsu, you can spend (Speed of move/3) AP (Rounded up) in order to have your ninken immediately use the same unarmed basic attack or unarmed Taijutsu against the same opponent. The target of the jutsu only declares one defense and if there is a roll involved, only rolls it once, applying the result to both attacks. If the defense has a chakra, stamina, or gear cost, it is also only paid once.  
If you are in a combo, attacks from your ninken don’t break your combo, and even if your attack misses your opponent, if your Ninken’s attack hits, your cadence rank increases.  
Your Ninken in Jujin Bunshin calculate their vitality for wounding purposes as being 75% of your maximum vitality (Instead of 50%), and if they take a severe wound whilst in Jujin Bunshin, they are knocked out of the technique. If this happens, or the technique is ended for any other reason, your Ninken rejoins the IC on the IC the technique ended. If the technique was ended via a wound, the ninken will still need to wait out the stun it just received before it can take any actions.

### **Gatsuga \- Fang Passing Fang**

Tsuga twice over. Both shinobi and transformed ninken coordinate their Tsuga movements to most effectively devastate the opponent or create an opening. Thus Gatsuga is typically much more difficult to avoid than Tsuga.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Stamina: 10+(5\*X)  
Damage: (STR /6)d10  
Range: AGI  
Speed: 10+(5\*X)  
Special: Finisher

Effects  
You can only use this as your finisher to a combo if your opener was Tsgua, and only if “Jujin Bunshin \- Beast Human Clone” is active.  
When you use this jutsu, your ninken does not use a coordinated offensive version of the same jutsu. Instead, you set X at any number up to your cadence rank, and you do this jutsu twice that many times, one after the other, you performing the jutsu the first time, your ninken performing it the second, and then swapping back between each other each time until between the two of you, you’ve used this jutsu X\*2 times.  
You only advance your IC and roll stamina for this jutsu once no matter what X is, it’s damage is always calculated as if it’s speed was 10, and this jutsu uses half your PDB (Your ninken also uses half it's PDB)  
Each individual attack that’s part of this jutsu does not wound, but once you’ve resolved all attacks involved, you add their damage together to calculate wounding damage.  
You still roll your ACC for this move as with all attacks done alongside your ninken in human clone form, but this move does not suffer from the \-2 ACC you would usually get. Each individual attack has its ACC rolled separately, and the target of the attack rolls their defense against each ACC individually instead of rolling once and applying it to all attacks, as they do against the human beast clone attacks. They still only advance their IC once, and only pay cha, stam, and gear costs once.  
You cannot spend AP to reduce the speed of this move.

This attack’s damage is increased by 1% for every 2 yards you travel as part of this jutsu, calculated per each attack. Additionally, unlike normal attacks, you don’t have to stop at your opponent and can continue moving using any remaining movement to move past your opponent. Your move while attacking is determined using the Speed 10 per attack.

### **Jinju Konbi Henge: Sotoro \- Human Beast Combination Transformation: DoubleHeaded Wolf**

This fearsome transformation technique combines shinobi and ninken into a massive two-headed wolf. While being in this form has its obvious benefits, this technique is most valued as an essential preparation for the Inuzukas’ most devastating form of Tsuga.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 6  
Speed: 12

Effects:  
Your ninken combines with you and may no longer take separate actions. You add your Ninken’s STR and AGI to your own, this affects everything STR and AGI would normally affect, except dodge bonus, and grapple rolls/TNs. This technique replaces four legged technique if used whilst four legged technique is in play when you use this. Your AGI is increased by 40% for the purpose of movement, you gain twice the bonuses you would have normally gained from your teamwork abilities, and if anyone goes into stealth within (AGI) range of you, you get to immediately take an awareness roll against their stealth TN with a \+5 bonus.  
Notably, you no longer roll for ACC, as you did when using Human Beast Clone.

Turning into this form also allows you to be ridden as a Speed 2 Delay 2 action. Once on top of you they can act as normal but anytime you move they are moved the same amount ignoring anything that would reduce their movement. You can always TTH for them without rolling while they ride you and they can TTH for you. They also do not suffer any ground based immobility while on top of you. If the person riding tries to dodge or moves in any way they are considered to end the riding condition.

### **Garouga \- Wolf Passing Fang**

In Sotoro form, the user creates a vortex similar to Tsuga; however, the speed and power of Garouga far surpasses any of its lower forms. In fact, the user spins so rapidly during the technique that he loses his effective field of vision. The target is tracked, instead, by scent, the Inuzuka using their enhanced canine senses to find their opponents. Inuzuka have split opponents right in two with direct hits from this attack.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank A  
Stamina: 20+(10\*X)  
Damage: (STR /6)d10  
Range: AGI  
Speed: 15+(10\*X)  
Special: Finisher

Effects:  
You can only use this as your finisher to a combo if your opener was Tsgua.  
When you use this jutsu, you set X at any number up to your cadence rank, and you do this jutsu that many times.  
You only advance your IC and roll stamina for this jutsu once no matter what X is, and this jutsu’s speed cannot be reduced in any way. This jutsu’s damage is always calculated as if its speed was 15\.  
Each individual attack that’s part of this jutsu does not wound, but once you’ve resolved all attacks involved, you add their damage together to calculate wounding damage.  
You roll ACC for this attack, instead of having 10 added to your ACC and using it as a flat value. Each individual attack has its ACC rolled separately, and the target of the attack rolls their defense against each ACC individual instead of rolling once and applying it to all attacks, as they do against human beast clone attacks. They still only advance their IC once, and only pay cha, Stam, and gear costs once.  
This Jutsu can only be used in Sotoro Form. You cannot spend AP to reduce the speed of this move.

This attack’s damage is increased by 1% for every 2 yards you travel as part of this jutsu, calculated per each attack. Additionally, unlike normal attacks, you don’t have to stop at your opponent and can continue moving using any remaining movement to move past your opponent. Your move while attacking is determined using the Speed 15 per attack.

## **Hyuuga**

Throughout their history, the Hyuuga have adhered closely to a tradition of segregating family members into either the Main House or the Branch House, typically on the basis of gender and sibling birth order. Members of the Main House control and direct the affairs of the Hyuuga clan at large, whereas the Branch House is tasked with faithfully serving and protecting members of the Main House and \-- in a wider scope \-- the interests of the entire Hyuuga clan.

This practice of sealing Branch House family members, however, came to its end through the concerted influence of three famed Hyuuga of the Fourth Shinobi World War. Thanks to their tireless spirit, cooperation, and heroic reputation garnered from the War, they won the crucial number of Main House members to their side, greatly healing a rift between the houses that had been ever-widening in previous decades. Soon afterward, the head of the Hyuuga clan decreed that thenceforth none would be branded with the seal.

With the divide between the houses now gone, the Hyuuga have risen to prominence both within and beyond their village as one of the most noble clans of Konoha. They are widely known for the distinct milky-white eyes, dark hair, and sophistication in the way they dress and talk. Shinobi of other nations tend to be wary of them, as their gentle fist style of fighting makes it impossible to tell just how competent a Hyuuga may be by their physical stature, with legends of one touch being enough to cripple an opponent.

### **Byakugan**

**Hyuuga begin with 1 less Unique Point.**

Activating the Byakugan is a Speed 1 action; it can't be used as an interrupt. Byakugan has an Upkeep of 2\.

You can differentiate between people and clones (except for Kage Bunshin), and tell if someone is using Henge (though this does not allow you to see their true form).

The Byakugan allows you to see through physical objects (though you're still aware of their presence). This gives you, in crude terms, "X-ray vision", except you see chakra instead of bones and dense objects. You can see everything in a CHA yard radius around you this way.

This allows you to spot jutsu-based traps and effects, and detect the presence of fuinjutsu placed on a person, item, or area. Whenever someone enters Stealth within your Byakugan radius, you can perform a Search action as a Speed 0 interrupt (this includes people that begin combat in Stealth, assuming you have Byakugan active during Initiative such as from Preparation ability). And always count as if you had done 2 more search actions than you actually did for the purposes of the consecutive search action bonus. Additionally, your Awareness checks have a \+5 bonus (as long as vision is involved, you do not get this bonus to notice a sound during an event, for example).

Your Byakugan also gives you immunity to all non-supernatural sources of Visibility penalties, such as: blindfolds, a weather condition, and smoke bombs. Notably, this does not apply to flash bombs. And you halve Chakra based sources of Visibility penalties such as the infamous “Hidden Mist” Jutsu. You are immune to Genjutsu which target an area instead of people, can automatically see through them as if they weren't there, and can tell when someone else is being affected by a Genjutsu from the disturbance in their chakra flow.

### **Jyuuken — Gentle Fist**

The taijutsu of the Hyuuga, unable to be utilized, much less mastered, by anyone not wielding Byakugan, due to its targeted strikes to the opponents tenketsu, debilitating their opponent’s chakra systems and internal organs.  Save for unique physiology or other abilities, Jyuuken is notoriously difficult to defend against once contact is made. While not an impressive Taijutsu style, it is considered one of the strongest.

Type:  Unarmed Taijutsu, Rank E  
Chakra: 8  
Damage: (CHA/8+4)d4  
Speed: 10  
Special: Opener

Requires: Byakugan Active

Effects:  

Jyuuken uses your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, instead of your Physical Damage Bonus, but all damage dealt is reduced by 30\%. This technique reduces blocking’s effectiveness by 25\%. If you strike an opponent wearing armor this attack cannot wound unless it was a called shot. Every time you hit someone with Jyuuken, you inflict Sealed Tenketsu 1\. Half of Jyuuken’s damage is dealt directly to an opponent’s HP while the rest is dealt to their vitality as normal (or hp is they run out of vitality. Jyuuken inflicts Piercing Wounds and calculates wounding by taking the total damage and comparing it to the opponents hp wounding thresholds.

Momentum: The combo jutsu gains all above effects of Jyuuken with the additions below

* The Stamina Cost is replaced with a Chakra Cost, \+5 (if it has both, add them together as a singular Chakra cost, without adding the normal \+5).  
* On hit, the Sealed Tenketsu increases by 1 per Rank of the Jutsu above E (D \= \+1, C \= \+2, etc).
* Each damage dice of the attack is replaced with a d4.

### **Hakke Kuushou \- Eight Trigrams Empty Palm**

One offensive counterpart to the defensive Hakkeshou Kaiten. Rather than releasing chakra from all tenketsu to form a protective barrier, chakra is released from certain tenketsu, typically the forearm and palm, to create a forceful thrust, which damages an opponent at a distance.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 8  
Damage: (CHA/10+4)d4  
Speed: 10  
Range: CHA/3  
Requires: Byakugan active

Effects: 

This jutsu follows the same rules as Jyuuken with the following exceptions:

* This attack does not apply Sealed Tenketsu.  
* The attack may be performed at a Range of CHA/3 and counts as a Ranged Ninjutsu Projectile Attack for purposes of defending.  
* The attack applies knockback of (CHA/10) yards directly away from the user.

### **Hakkeshou Kaiten \- Eight Trigrams Palm Revolving Heaven**

The absolute defense of the Hyuuga clan, to use this technique the ninja simultaneously releases chakra from every tenketsu in their body and begins spinning rapidly. The combined effect is to generate a virtually impervious shield of rotating chakra; what makes it truly effective is that the chakra used won't dissipate until the user finally comes to a stop.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Stamina: 5 \+ X  
Chakra: 5 \+ X  
Damage: No base damage.  
Speed: 6 \+ X  
Special: Interrupt, Abort  
Requires: Byakugan active 

Effects:

This technique is always considered Speed 6 for determining whether it can Interrupt a given attack, regardless of how its Speed or Base Speed is modified. If used as an Interrupt, you make an accuracy roll with a \+X/2 bonus against the opponent's Accuracy; failure means you are hit, but activate Kaiten immediately afterwards.

Kaiten lasts for its full Speed in IC after being used. For example, if you used it on IC 22 when attacked, paying 8 Chakra and Stamina, it would last until IC (22+6+3) 31\. Any time after the first 6 IC have passed, you may abort Kaiten. Kaiten flawlessly deflects any ninjutsu or taijutsu. Though it cannot be used to Interrupt genjutsu, you cannot be targeted by them while Kaiten is in progress.

Kaiten's radius is up to CHA/20 yards. Anyone in range when it's activated must defend against it as a Rank C AoE Taijutsu attack of its full Speed that uses NDB instead of PDB and has no base damage. Whether the defense is successful or not, anyone targeted is knocked to the edge of the radius. If Kaiten is activated inside of a persistent AoE effect (such as a cloud, or water slick) with a radius equal to or less than its own, it ends that effect.

This technique's only true weakness is that it is ineffective if the user cannot spin. If suffering from a \-6 or greater immobilization penalty, you may not utilize Kaiten.

### **Juukenpo Ichigekishin \- Gentle Fist Art One Blow Body**

Another offensive use of the Hyuuga's ability to release chakra from his tenketsu. Here a force is created and directed against an opponent, or even against the espoused weakness of some technique in order to dispel it, using the Byakugan's ability to see chakra. In either case, the force created can easily send most opponents flying.

Type: Taijutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 15+X  
Speed: 14, Interrupt  
Requires: Byakugan active

Effects: This jutsu ends the effect of any Immobilization penalty on the Hyuuga stemming from an outside source, such as Combat Acupuncture, Clay Bullet, or Attached Meteor; any other effect that restrains them with an outside force like ropes; and any other effect that prevents the Hyuuga from taking actions due to an external restraint, such as Water Prison. X is equal to the total Immobilization Penalty the Hyuuga is suffering plus the Upkeep cost of all hostile Jutsu that would be ended by this effect. This Jutsu does not prevent status effects from Genjutsu, Poison, or anything that doesn't require the constant presence of something outside of the Hyuuga's body. If you are in a clinch you force a grapple roll against anyone currently grappling you, with you gaining \+10 to your grapple TN. If you succeed, the grapple ends immediately. This does not automatically destroy walls or break Hyuuga out of an area meant to confine them, such as a prison or Doton: Domu. A Hyuuga may always use this jutsu if they know it, even if circumstances would otherwise prevent them from acting.

### **Hakke Sanjuuni Shou \- Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms**

Type: Unarmed Taijutsu, Rank D  
Stamina: 16  
Damage: (CHA/8+8)d4  
Speed: 12  
Special: Finisher  
Requires: Byakugan active  
Combo Bonus: \+2d4 damage, \+1 Stun, \+1 Sealed Tenketsu, \+0.5 Immobilize

Effects: This attack uses your NDB and inflicts Sealed Tenketsu 2, reduces Blocking’s effectiveness by 25%, ignores armor, bypasses half of an opponent’s DR, and deals Piercing wounds. This attack may not be converted with Jyuuken. The immobility fr4om this technique ends when the targets stun condition goes away.

### **Hakke Rokujuyon Shou \- Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms**

Type: Unarmed Taijutsu, Rank C  
Stamina: 22  
Damage: (CHA/6+12)d4  
Speed: 16  
Special: Finisher  
Requires: Byakugan active  
Combo Bonus: \+4d4 damage, \+2 Stun, \+2 Sealed Tenketsu, \+1 Immobilize

Effects: This attack uses your NDB and inflicts Sealed Tenketsu 4, reduces Blocking’s effectiveness by 25%, ignores armor, bypasses half of an opponent’s DR, and deals Piercing wounds. This attack may not be converted with Jyuuken.

### **Hakke Hyaku Nijuuhachi Shou \- Eight Trigrams One Hundred Twenty-Eight Palms**

Type: Unarmed Taijutsu, Rank B  
Stamina: 34  
Damage: (CHA/4+16)d4  
Speed: 20  
Special: Finisher  
Requires: Byakugan active  
Combo Bonus: \+8d4 damage, \+4 Stun, \+4 Sealed Tenketsu, \+1.5 Immobilize

Effects: This attack uses your NDB and inflicts Sealed Tenketsu 8, reduces Blocking’s effectiveness by 25%, ignores armor, bypasses half of an opponent’s DR, and deals Piercing wounds. This attack may not be converted with Jyuuken.

### **Sealed Tenketsu**

This is a Status Effect, applied on hit, that penalizes Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to its Severity, and half that (rounding down) to Stamina rolls. If you ever fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll while you have this status, whatever technique you were trying to use fails (but you advance in Fatigue as normal), and you lose Hit Points (not Vitality) equal to the Chakra cost of that technique.

Sealed Tenketsu stacks fully with itself, but a victim’s body naturally will try to correct its chakra flow to meet demands in battle: Every time someone with this status takes the Rest action it reduces by 1, and when they advance in Fatigue, they lower their Sealed Tenketsu Severity by their (Chakra Control Ranks/4), minimum 1\. Outside of combat, Sealed Tenketsu is reduced by the same (Chakra Control Ranks/4), minimum 1, every hour.

## **Nara**

A modestly-sized yet highly influential clan in Leaf, the Nara primarily use secret ninjutsu techniques which manipulate shadows, using them to disable opponents and control the battlefield. What they're truly known for, however, is their many medical advances. While the clan produces few talented medical nin, a disproportionate number of the advances in theory and actual, physical medicines and treatments seem to come from the Nara. The pills used by the Akimichi clan are just one example of the Nara's medical breakthroughs.  
The Akimichi, Nara, and Yamanaka clan have always enjoyed a special relationship with one another, often working in teams and as allies; that bond stands at the heart of Leaf village, and is often looked to by other shinobi as an example of Konoha's unity.

### **Kagemane no Jutsu \- Shadow Imitation Technique**

The Nara extends their shadow and links it to another person (or their shadow) and links themselves to a target, which gives the Nara total control over their target’s movement and actions for as long as the connection can be maintained. The control requires a lot of chakra, however, and targets can eventually break free with sustained resistance.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 12 \+ X \* 4  
Range: CHA/8  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 6  
Special: \-6 Accuracy Penalty.

Effects: X is the number of times you’ve previously used this jutsu in the present battle. You gain control over your target’s actions, and while you maintain this jutsu’s Upkeep, they can take no action which requires physical movement or control of their own body, save for talking; however, your target can try to resist your control.

While caught, the following effects apply:

* The Victim can not move, however if you move, they move in a way that is mirrored to you as they are always considered to be facing you; if you move toward them, they move toward you. If you turn left, they turn right (Meaning you both move in the same direction), etc. They will move the exact same amount of Yards as you, in the same amount of ICs as you. Regardless of their normal Movement speed as their body will force itself to keep up with you. If the Victim's Movement speed (after all modifications such as Status Effects) happened to be lower than yours when you move, then even though they will manage to keep up, the act will slowly exhaust their body as they will lose 1 AP for every Yard of movement they wouldn't have been able to normally cover in that amount of ICs.  However, if you move (or are forced to move) away from the Victim beyond double this jutsu’s range, your shadow is severed from them and this Jutsu ends automatically. If you receive Knockback, then they will also receive Knockback (ignoring any immunity or reductions to the Status Effect they normally have) of an equal value and to an opposite direction from you. But the case is not the same if they were to initially receive Knockback.  
* The Victim can not take Actions, but they will mirror any Action you perform , including doing any Jutsu which you perform (Further details regarding this mentioned below). If you spend AP on an Action, the Target will not pay any AP of their own, yet they will still use your modified Speed as their own. If you pull out any weapons or items from your person, they will also pull out something from the same location, except that they can choose what item to pull out. This can be mitigated if you explicitly store your gear and weapons in uncommon and odd locations (Which must be explicitly stated at the start of the Combat encounter). You can make them perform any mundane task or Action, including forcing them to disarm themselves. They pay the Fatigue costs for any actions you make them perform, though you must perform the same action. If you make them perform an Attack, their attack uses your Accuracy, rather than their own.  
* You can force the victim to draw an item or weapon you do not have (Or have otherwise stored on your body in an unconventional location), by using a “Draw Weapon” action, but this can only be done to items you have seen your opponent use previously in this fight at least once or that they have in an obvious spot, after you know where they store them.  
* If you Attack the Victim, they will use the same Attack against you using the details mentioned next: If you perform a Taijutsu Attack then the Victim will mimic the exact Attack even if they don't have the Jutsu or aren't typically capable of it, and apply any Abilities you applied to your Attack even if the Victim doesn't have them, using your Base Total PDB in place of their own without any of your own temporary Bonuses. However, if you have a longer Reach than the Victim (Such as through a Weapon, Uniques, etc), they will take a \-1 to their own Taijutsu Accuracy per every 2 Reach difference between the two of you, and vice versa if they happen to be the one with the longer Reach. If you perform any Ninjutsu or Genjutsu you know against the Victim, they will mimic the exact same Jutsu, though using their own values for Range, Area, NDB, and Chakra Exhaustion where relevant. If the Victim didn't have the Jutsu learned, then they will take a \+3 increase to the Chakra Cost of the Jutsu, and if they weren't originally capable of performing that entire category of Jutsus (eg: Katon, Medical, Genjutsu), then they will take a \+6 increase to the Chakra Cost instead. If they knew the Jutsu, then they simply perform it as normal.  
* You can also Target something else with your Jutsu or Attack, in which case, the Victim will mirror your Target (for example: If you Target the spot just behind the Victim, then the Victim will Target the spot just behind you. If you Target a spot on the left, both of you will target that spot). If your Target was another character, then both you and the Victim will Attack said Target at the same time, with the Victim having \-3 to their Accuracy.  
* Anytime you make the Victim perform an Action, both of your ICs are advanced by the appropriate amount.  
* Anytime your Victim is attacked, you can partially relax this Technique long enough for them to defend themselves, or maintain control and force them into taking no Defensive Action in response. If you choose the latter option, they immediately get a roll to attempt to break free, with an additional \+5 bonus to whatever other bonuses they had already accrued . Success means they are freed from this Jutsu and can defend themselves from the attack aimed at them, though it is considered a Surprise Attack against them.  
* Anyone caught by this technique can, once every 15 ICs, attempt to break free as a free Grapple Check, rolling as the Attacker in a Grapple. You use 20+CHA/10+DEX/20+CC/5-X to determine your own Grapple TN. Every time the Victim makes a Grapple Roll to escape this Jutsu and fails, no matter the source of the Roll, they gain a cumulative \+5 bonus to all future rolls to escape Kagemane.  
* Anytime the Victim gains a Fatigue level while under the effect of Kagemane, they receive a free attempt to escape this Jutsu.

### **Multiple Shadow Bind**

You can Target multiple people with the Kagemane and Kagenui Techniques. Every person beyond the first adds \+5 to that Jutsu’s Chakra Cost, and for the case of Kagemane, \+2 to its Upkeep. You may Target up to 1 additional person per Rank.

Type: Ability  
Base Cost: 6  
Scale: 4  
Limit: CHA /30

### **Kagebuki Shibari no Jutsu \- Shadow Neck-Binding Technique**

A more advanced version of Kagemane No Jutsu, this extends the user's shadow up a victim, creating elongated hands and arms to wrap around and strangle, or otherwise injure, the victim.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 5 \+ X  
Speed: 2 \+ X

Effects:  
This can be used only on someone who's already trapped by your Kagemane No Jutsu. You can use this Technique to perform any Grapple Taijutsu you know as if the victim of your Kagemane No Jutsu was Pinned as per the D rank move “Takedown”. This is limited, so you cannot perform any Technique that requires either you or your opponent to make a Grapple Check, but for all other moves you perform them using your CHA instead of your STR, use your NDB instead of your PDB, and you count as having unlimited “shadow arms/legs” for any techniques which require the dedicated use of one of your limbs

This Technique has a chakra cost of the grapple move you’re performing’s stamina cost \+5, and a Speed of the grapple move you’re performing \+2.

Notably, even though this is a Technique that you’re using whilst you have an opponent under Shadow Imitation Technique, using this Technique does not trigger your Victim to use a mimicked Attack against you.

You may not use the following Grapple Taijutsu with Kagebuki Shibari no Jutsu: Headbutt, Suplex

### **Kage Nui no Jutsu \- Shadow Sewing Technique**

This materializes shadows, allowing them to physically attack and bind an opponent (and, well, leave the ground). The user reshapes their shadow into several needle-tipped tendrils and attempts to impale an enemy with them.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 10 \+ X \* 3  
Damage: (X\*3)d10  
Accuracy: \+2  
Range: CHA/5  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 8  
Special: X Immobilization Penalty

Effects: X has a maximum of 6\. This Jutsu counts as a "Use" for Kagemane No Jutsu. This technique deals Piercing damage. When Targeting anyone affected by Shadow Sewing’s Immobilization Penalty with Kagemane No Jutsu, that Technique loses a certain amount of its inherent Accuracy penalty equal to the Immobilization provided by this Jutsu (Potentially nullifying it completely). Should Kagemane No Jutsu successfully hit, the Target loses any Immobilization penalties caused by Shadow Sewing.

### **Kageyose no Jutsu \- Shadow Endgame Technique**

Working on the same principle as the Shadow Sewing Technique, this uses materialized shadows. Unlike Shadow Sewing, it allows for precise control of the shadow's movements; the user splits their shadow off into potentially dozens of fully prehensile shadow tendrils, small enough to slip through keyholes and dexterous enough to lift keys off of hooks.

Type: Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 6  
Range: CHA/3  
Speed: 16

Effect: You can use your shadow tendrils to grab onto things (or people) or attack, in the following ways, for as long as you maintain this Upkeep:

* Retrieve Object (X AP) \- Your shadows pick up X unattended objects on the battlefield that are within range; if it’s ever relevant, you can pick up (and hold onto) up to CHA/8 objects this way at once.  
* Grab (5 AP) \- As per the E-Rank Grapple jutsu.  
* Bind (Variable AP) \- You can have your Shadows use any Grapple jutsu you know.  
* Attack (Variable AP) \- Using a weapon it is holding or can get access to (including Multithrows).

You pay 1 AP for every 2 Speed of the action you wish your Shadows to make, and can pay more AP to reduce the effective Speed of their action further if you wish. You may use any of the above options at most once every 10 IC. You use your NDB in place of PDB for Damage and CHA in place of STR for Grapple Checks, with Grapple Checks receiving an additional \+4 bonus. You use CHA in place of STR or RES wherever appropriate otherwise. Your shadow tendrils are considered to have unlimited limbs for Grapples.

### **Nara Clarifications**

Listed here are some mechanical clarifications for some niche circumstances you may encounter whilst using Kagemane No Jutsu.

* When using an attack of any sort if you and your opponent have different ranges for whatever reason on mimicked moves (large unique, being forced to use different ninjutsu, different strength for throwing weapons) and one of those ranges would not put the opponent within that range, the attack auto misses.  
* In the case of Genjutsu, even if your opponent doesn’t know any genjutsu, they are still aware a genjutsu technique has been used.  
* If you use an unarmed Taijutsu whilst the victim is holding something in their hands, they drop whatever is in their hands before mimicking the unarmed Taijutsu.  
* If you use any action with a seal speed whilst the victim is holding something in their hands, they drop the item in their hands before mimicking the seals you are performing  
* The victim does not need to have taken the appropriate talent to be forced to use a Hyper Element technique.  
* When forcing someone to declare no defense against an attack, if you succeed, effects which have scaling damage based on a failed defense (Such as Crosswave, or Fuuma Shuriken) do not gain any bonus.  
* You cannot force someone who has the “Full Pockets” unique to use their unique to reflexively purchase an item.

Even whilst in Kagemane your victim can still take the following actions:

* Genjutsu being used by Sharingan.  
* Hozuki hydrate, or reform  
* The “Meditate” action.  
* The “Close Gates” action.  
* The “Search” action.  
* The “Rest” action.

## **Senju**

Once known as the Senju Clan of the Forest, and allegedly descended from the Sage of Six Paths, founder of ninjutsu, himself, the history of the Senju clan is the history of Konoha. They founded the village, the First, Second, and Fifth Hokages were all members of descendants of the clan, and it's said the First Hokage used his Senju bloodline to create the very village itself. Their name, meaning Thousand Hands, came from their peerless talents in all aspects of ninja skills: if there was every a 'greatest clan' of ninja, it was them. They're also virtually extinct. The clan itself died out generations ago. Of the perhaps dozen people alive who actually were born with the Senju name, almost none of them actually manifest their clan's abilities. The bloodline is as persistent and hardy as the forests it symbolizes, though. In every generation, a handful of ninja will be born who exhibit the traits of the Senju bloodline, and inevitably their lineage will be traced a Senju ancestor, sometimes more than a century distant. Some even unofficially take the Senju name out of respect.

**Senju start with 1 less Unique Point and begin with Elemental Aptitude for Water and Earth. They also have Elemental Affinity for Mokuton, which includes Suiton and Doton.**

### **Mokuton \- Wood Release**

The Senju bloodline, once famed for their limitless talents, have fallen far, but one trait remains--or, rather, it's the only one that can be recognized as a sign of Senju heritage. That is Mokuton, combining Water and Earth natured chakra to produce wood-related jutsu. It should be noted that this is wood, specifically, and to a lesser extent, trees--they don't have (despite what legends claim) plant empathy, the ability to restore life to wilting flowers, or anything similar. Any Suiton or Doton technique can be converted to Mokuton, with the following effects:

* +5 Chakra cost
* Suiton techniques that create Water Gallons instead create an equivalent amount of Seeds. Seeds can be spent for Mokuton techniques in the same manner as Gallons of Water, except you lose only half of the spent Seeds rather than all.
* Seeds can be targeted by any Katon attack, which lands automatically. In which case, 1 Seed is burnt and disappears for every 50 damage the Katon attack deals. Area Katon attacks do not need to specifically target the Seeds to burn them.
* Suiton transformed Mokuton techniques can receive double the benefits from spending Seeds. But if done so, the entire amount of Seeds used is spent, rather than half.
* Doton damaging attacks apply the “Sea of Thorns” environmental effect across their Area
* Non-Area Doton attacks gain an Area of ten and the appropriate tag, Area Doton attacks instead have their area increased by 5.
* The Upkeep of Mokuton techniques is reduced by CHA/30, to a minimum of half its original value. This is applied before uniques and other effects.
* The Chakra Exhaustion penalties incurred by using Mokuton techniques are reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1. This is applied after uniques and other effects.
Mokuton is weak to Raiton, but strong against Suiton and Katon.



### **Sea of Thorns**

This isn’t a Status Condition, rather the Senju creates forests of vines covered in supernaturally sharp thorns that shred through anything.

Anyone inside the affected area moving by any means or dodging, takes NDB*(Yards moved inside the Area) Piercing Damage that cannot be mitigated or reduced in any way (Even by DR). And every cumulative 15 yards moved inside a “Sea of Thorns” area grants Immobilization 1 that stacks with Immobilization sources coming from Mokuton. Dodging counts as moving 5 yards for both damage calculations and the stacking immobilization. The area can be targeted by any form of damaging Area attack so long as it is within range, in which case, so long as the attack deals CHA*4 damage but the *4 is reduced by 1 for every 10 yards the radius extends (minimum of 1), the Sea of Thorns within the Area of that offensive jutsu is destroyed. Raiton is treated as dealing twice the amount of damage.

A Senju inside the area is unaffected by neither the Damage, nor the Immobilization of Sea of Thorns. And activating Mokuton Mud Wave gives CHA bonus to AGI rather than CHA/2.

### **Moku Bunshin no Jutsu \- Wood Clone Technique**

This technique takes advantage of mokuton's ability to accelerate plant growth by converting some of the user's cells into, essentially, plant matter; the wood clone physically buds off the user before taking on their appearance.

Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Cost: 1 Willpower per clone  
Speed: 10, \+3 per clone

Effects:  
Wood clones follow most normal rules for clones, but have your CHA\*3 as HP, and use your attributes. They always start at fatigue 0, do not suffer wounds, and you may only ever have up to three at once in existence. They may perform any action you normally could, by spending 1 AP per 3 Speed of that action. Notably, they are capable of performing Meditation and gathering NC (Natural Chakra). However, after reaching Fatigue 2 they decay into lifeless wood pulp and fall apart. Wood clones may not take actions with a chakra or stamina cost greater than 20+(your RES for taijutsu, or CHA for ninjutsu)/10.

Wood clones have your mind, and can act independently. You are aware of their location, and they yours, though your senses are not linked. You may reabsorb a 'living' wood clone by touching it, in which case you 'download' all its memories. Including any Natural Chakra points the Wood clones had gathered through Meditation.

When Wood Clones attack they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage.

### **Mokuton: Shichuurou no Jutsu \- Wood Release: Four Pillars Prison Technique**

After completing the handseals, you place your hands on the ground and channel your chakra beneath your target, where it bursts from the ground as timbers which grow rapidly and form a wooden, usually cubic, prism. The timbers used in this technique are heavily infused with chakra, making them very resilient.

Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank C  
Chakra: 25  
Range: 30  
Area: Up to 20 yard x 20 yard x 20 yard cube  
Speed: 16  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
This is the Mokuton 'version' of the Water Prison and/or Water Drowning techniques, which cannot be directly converted into Mokuton themselves.  
It creates a wooden cage around anyone who can't escape its area, which has 200+(damage bonus)\*10 HP, and reduces all damage it takes by your CHA. People inside cannot attack people outside, and vice versa.

### **Mokuton: Jukai Koutan \- Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees**

This technique uses chakra to cause trees and tree roots to grow rapidly, bursting from any surface. It's too unrefined to be used as a direct method of offense, but can be useful for altering the landscape of a battlefield.

Type: Mokuton Ninjutsu, Rank B  
Chakra: 5 \+ X  
Range: (Damage bonus)\*5  
Area: X  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 16

Effects:  
This overwrites any terrain-based effects on the area it's used on. By changing the cost to 5 \+ X\*2, it can be used to create a one-story building. The complexity of this building is determined by your Chakra Control.  
At 10 Chakra Control or less, it's more like a crude bundle of tree trunks and branches that will at least keep most of the rain out. From 11 \- 20, it's about as well-built as a log cabin, with up to three rooms. At 21 \- 30, it could actually pass for a real building, aside from the lack of anything made of metal. At 31+ Chakra Control, you can add a second story to the building.

## **Uchiha**

The Uchiha clan once had a proud history, as one of the greatest shinobi clans the world knew before the advent of ninja villages. Unfortunately, by the present the only widely known aspect of their heritage is that they produced two of the greatest traitors in ninja history: Uchiha Kengo, and Uchiha Jinsei

Perhaps it's for the best, then, that the clan was effectively eradicated over a hundred years ago--most of the stigma was left behind, buried with their corpses.

Konoha has spared no effort in trying to revive the Uchiha clan, and has been, surprisingly, successful. Special Jounin were assigned the sole task of tracking down people with Uchiha ancestry--second cousins, someone whose grandfather had married out of the clan, illegitimate children- \-and encouraging them to reproduce with one another; either through marriage, or emotionless affairs.

It worked, though it took a few generations. Any child who manifested the Sharingan was offered the Uchiha name, along with their entire immediate family. These new Uchiha were encouraged to take pride in their bloodline, and in the fact that they were resurrecting it. The village offered a multitude of incentives, did its best to discourage the stigma of shinobi who were essentially volunteering to be breeding stock, and even constructed the budding clan its own compound--not to isolate them, but to help them feel special. Despite some muttered protests throughout the village, they were even reinstated as one of Konoha's four noble clans.

Some shinobi are resentful of the perceived special treatment the Uchiha receive; others take it in stride, accepting that it's in the village's best interest to revitalize one of its most powerful bloodlines. Admittedly, the Uchiha clan--now almost large enough to actually be considered one, though most of its members haven't, and never will, manifested its traits--has yet to live up to its legendary prowess; it's claimed that in the past, all an Uchiha had to do was make eye contact to force a foe to commit suicide. Whether or not they ever shall reclaim their feared and honored status remains to be seen.

Outside of their normal training, all members of the Uchiha clan are taught how to use Katon ninjutsu while growing up. Accordingly, they start with the Elemental Aptitude ability for Fire.

**Uchiha begin with 1 less Unique Point and begin with the Elemental Aptitude for Fire.**

                                                **Sharingan \- Copy Wheel Eye**

The sharingan is a doujutsu, or 'eye technique'; when it manifests, the user's irises turn red, and a tomoe (essentially a comma-shaped mark) appears in the iris, like a second pupil. Another tomoe appears in each eye at the second, and then third stages, for a maximum of three.

The Sharingan's greatest disadvantage is that it is dependent upon one's unimpeded visibility. None of the powers provided by it may be used when you're at a Visibility penalty of \-6 or greater.

Unfortunately for the Uchiha, they are not inherently able to access this power. In times of need--generally when under severe combat-related stress--the doujutsu will activate itself. This is GM-regulated; you'll be informed if this takes place. When it does, your Sharingan immediately activates at the stage above the highest you've achieved, and from then on you may activate that stage at will.

However, once a shinobi is talented enough, they'll be able to activate their Sharingan's higher stages for the first time without need for that external stimulus. At 1000, 2000, and 3000 XP you automatically gain access to the First, Second, and Third Stage Sharingan, respectively, if you haven't already. Legends speaks of a fourth stage, though no one in recent memory has obtained it.

### **Sharingan, Stage 1**

Maintaining the Sharingan active is almost trivially easy, a mere Upkeep 2 effect. Activating it is a Speed 1 Action, which can be performed alongside another technique or Interrupt, adding to their Speed.

At the first stage, you are able to acquire the Dousatsugan and Saimingan techniques. Both are learned as D-rank jutsu, though have no skill or rank requirements. You may choose to purchase these as soon as you unlock Stage 1, even if you don't have enough XP to do so--in which case you are, essentially, in 'XP debt' until you have enough.

### **Sharingan, Stage 2**

The Sharingan's second stage adds a second tomoe to each eye, and is when the bulk of the doujutsu's power begins to manifest. Their ability to copy techniques and actions becomes refined, to the level of being able to extrapolate from fine details and mimic even small mannerisms.  
You may obtain Yogengan and Shouningan. They are learned as if they're C-rank techniques, though again, have no skill or rank requirements to learn. You may choose to purchase them as soon as you unlock Stage 2, going into XP debt if necessary.

### **Sharingan, Stage 3**

The third tomoe appears, with the three marks forming a ring halfway between the pupil and the rim of the iris, equidistant from one another. Upon reaching this stage, you can copy any genjutsu used upon you by another Uchiha with their Eye of Hypnotism power, despite its lack of handseals (again, assuming you meet the proper requirements). You may also learn Magen: Kyouten Chiten and Senchigan. They're treated as B-rank techniques, you know the rest by now.

### **Dousatsugan \- Eye of Insight**

Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan

You can see the flow of chakra. This gives you a \+3 bonus to defense rolls against genjutsu. More impressively, it allows you to copy any taijutsu technique you witness being performed, along with any ninjutsu or genjutsu which use handseals.

This technique's greatest limitation is its user. You must meet all skill requirements for the technique, and can't copy elemental ninjutsu you don't have the appropriate Elemental Aptitude for; Sealing and Medical techniques both require access to those types of jutsu in order for you to copy them. This does have one advantage over learning techniques the "old-fashioned" way: you can copy techniques one rank above what you could normally learn (which may vary by category).

You automatically learn any valid techniques you see, and can use them for the remainder of the day. To keep them permanently, you must pay the normal XP cost to learn the technique in question. You may go into 'XP debt' learning a technique this way, but only if you are not already in XP debt.

You may not copy custom or clan jutsu, as those are tailored too specifically to either the individual or the clan in question.

### **Saimingan \- Eye of Hypnotism**

Requires: Stage 1 Sharingan

You may perform genjutsu without handseals; however, this requires direct eye contact, meaning it can't be used from hiding, must be targeting a person (rather than an area), and can be avoided entirely if they simply shut their eyes (which brings its own penalties) or never look directly at your eyes. Which can be done by just, say, staring at your, or their, feet, and affects them with a \-4 visibility penalty. Once you unlock the second stage of the Sharingan, all genjutsu have their chakra cost reduced by 5\.

### **Yogengan \- Eye of Prediction**

Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan

Once per Fatigue category, you may declare use of this technique. It allows you to "take 10" on any defensive roll; rather than rolling 1d20, you treat it as if your result had been a 10\. You may also declare your action as 'Observe', a variable speed action similar to blocking, in that for its duration, when attacked you may choose to activate Yogengan against any attack directed against you (and not have it count as your one use for that Fatigue category). The “take 10” becomes a “take 12” once you unlock stage 3 Sharingan.

### **Shouningan \- Eye of Recognition**

Requires: Stage 2 Sharingan

For starters, you can read lips. This is not some kind of ultra undetectable super long-range spying technique; but is very effective so long as you can see their lips in some form or another. though you can make an opposed Espionage roll to avoid them noticing if you’re doing it in close range, if you're trying to hide the fact that you're staring at their face.  
You can also copy a person's handwriting just by seeing them write a single sentence. You can speed-read, and have a photographic memory. This has other uses, such as being able to tell how to pick a given lock by watching one person do it, or how to open a combination lock (though not necessarily the combination itself) by watching the movements of someone's arms or hands as they do it. You also gain a \+4 bonus to all awareness rolls so long as they use your eyes in some form.

### **Magen: Kyouten Chiten \- Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change**

A form of illusion reversal, in which a Sharingan user instantly and simultaneously sees through and decrypts a genjutsu technique, and then instantly reflects it upon its original user. Some Uchiha will go so far as to claim that this technique makes them immune to genjutsu, and they're... not too far from the truth.

Type: Genjutsu  
Speed: 6, Special  
Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan

Effects:  
This may be used immediately after passing a defensive roll against a genjutsu targeting you. You immediately perform that genjutsu on its original user (paying its normal chakra cost) via your Eye of Hypnotism, using your defensive roll's result as its new Gen Off. This adds 6 to the initiative count on which you next act, as if it was an interrupt. This can only be used on genjutsu which you know (though copying them as they're performed, and then reflecting them, is fair game).

### **Senchigan \- Eye of Foresight**

Requires: Stage 3 Sharingan

It was once claimed, and rarely still is, that the Sharingan genuinely allows its wielder to see the future. What it actually does is pick up on minute changes in an opponent's posture, minor eye movements, slight shifts of their weight, muscles tensing or relaxing in preparation for movement, even chakra building up in preparation for a jutsu.

When you declare the use of this ability, declare a category of technique (such as Weapon Taijutsu, Katon, or Combo Taijutsu) and a Speed. Your opponent then declares and rolls (if applicable) their defense. Any Interrupt may be used that's valid against your declared Speed.

After seeing this result, you may choose to use any technique of the declared type, with Speed equal to or lesser than your declared Speed. Its damage is based on its normal Speed, but its ability to be Interrupted, and when you take your next action, are based on the declared Speed. Any technique used this way has its Stamina or Chakra cost(s) increased by 4\.

If you choose to use a technique against which their reaction is invalid (such as performing Doton: Domu after they had rolled a 20 on their Suiton: Sujinheki), they do not have to move their IC by the speed of their Interrupt. Though they still get hit and pay the chakra cost. On the other hand, using a technique that somehow bypasses their defense (such as Earthen Skewer against Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu) is fair game.

## **Asashi**

**Asashi start with 1 less Unique Point and begin with Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Lightning. They also have Elemental Affinity for Taiton, which includes Katon and Raiton.**

### **Day Bringer**

Pale skinned, frail bodied, opaque eyed. The Asashi are not what many would expect when they hear of a clan capable of bringing with them the life-giving rays of the Sun wherever they go. But then again, not many are familiar with their origin, or the origin of their shining powers. Once a simple tribe that hid underground to escape the brutal wars of the Shinobi World, they discovered an entirely new world down below. One of bioluminescent fungi and fauna, an entirely secluded eco-system, and a glowing miniature sun at the center of it all that provided the light and heat necessary for all of that to exist. Generations living under the rays of that hidden had permanently infused their bloodline with the same mysterious energies that made everything else glow, and gave them the radiant ability to manifest that light into their own personal Kekkei Genkai. Yet it also robbed them of their sight, as the radiation of that miniature sun had burned away their eyes into pale, useless organs. This has not changed even once they resurfaced, after centuries of hiding, it had become another aspect of their bloodline. Solemn and demure, the Asashi have been denied the right to ever witness the world that they bring light to. Not in the normal way that everybody else does, at least. But they do not mind that, nor do they hold it as a curse, for they have developed their own ways of perceiving the world that are far more potent.

Effects: You are blind. But thankfully, you’ve spent your entire life being blind and have gotten used to it. This gives you a \-8 Visibility penalty. And the base cap for how high your Visibility penalty can get is \-8. Blind Fighting can take this cap further down to a max of \-4, lowering the penalty of your blindness. Additionally, though you are blind, you can still "sense" the light, allowing you to distinguish in vague, general shapes everything that is touched by a source of light (And by extent, also any sources of light themselves) within CHA\*2 radius. You may use this even in places that you are not physically present in, so long as they’re within that distance. Remember that this could only ever tell you general shapes, it can tell you that there's a person in the room next door, but not what they have on them, nor the fact that there's an Explosive Tag attached to the door and ready to explode if anybody opened it. It also doesn't help against hidden enemies.

Unfortunately, the natural sources of light that typically exist (Even the sun) do not give you enough details to help you all that much during a fight where Shinobi might be moving AT near light speeds. So you still retain your Visibility penalty despite being generally aware of where people are. However, you are so attuned to any sources of light created by Taiton, that you can actually "See" anything touched by the light. Becoming a brightly shining realm of details in the sea of darkness that you permanently live in. Though you cannot distinguish colors, it is practically as if you have regained vision in relation to anything touched by the light of your Taiton techniques. You do not suffer any Visibility penalties when targeting anything lit up by a Taiton light source for any action (Search, attacks, etc). Even if you had other sources of Visibility penalties applied to you. However, your Visibility is still applied against Ranged Attacks originating outside of a Taiton light source.

Furthermore, as a Speed 2, Upkeep 1 Action, you may become bioluminescent. Radiating a bright white light which extends up to CHA/5 Yards. In addition to removing Darkness based penalties for anybody else around you or targeting you. This also counts as a Taiton light source for the benefits mentioned above.

### **Taiton \- Solar Release**

Combining fire and lightning chakra results in the advanced nature of Taiton or “Solar Release”; allowing the user to fire off blindingly fast and extremely condensed beams of light that can penetrate and burn a hole through any object or person.

Any Katon or Raiton Technique may be converted to Taiton, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra Cost  
* Taiton ignores half DR.  
* Taiton only deals 75% of Final Damage.  
* Taiton techniques with a Range have their Range increased by NDB, which counts as the new Base Range for the Enhanced Range Ability.  
* Taiton techniques count as being (Rank of Jutsu) Speed lower for the purpose of moving your IC, to a minimum of 5\. This benefit extends to the special movement option provided by Racing Thunder Technique as well as Taijutsu attacks done by weapon creation Techniques, reducing how much both move your IC by 3, to a minimum of 3 instead of 5\.  
* Taiton receives a \+(CHA/30) Accuracy Bonus.  
* Taiton Damage Dealing Techniques cannot have an Area and only hit a single Target. Instead, any Area (Adding the potential increase from Enhanced Area) is turned into an ultra-concentrated beam that penetrates any defense the opponent has, dealing (Area)% of the attack's Total Damage (As in, before the 25% Damage reduction of Taiton) as extra, separate damage that goes directly to the target's HP. This extra damage may apply a Wound and is calculated before any Partial Defense or Armor is applied. And the Wounds from this extra damage bypass Armor Wound negations. Any Wounding bonuses are applied separately to both the normal damage and this extra HP damage.  
* Katon transformed Taiton Techniques also causes the targeted spot (Whether the attack hits a target or not) to radiate a fluorescent light of a radius of 10 Yard which lasts for 20 ICs before fading away. Techniques with an Area instead use that area for the radius of the light (Even if that Area is nullified by Taiton’s above stated property). This imparts a \-(Radius of light/2) Stealth penalty to anybody within the supernaturally lit area, and counts as a Taiton light source.  
* Raiton transformed Taiton Techniques do not apply Paralysis. Instead they apply a Visibility penalty equal to (1+Paralysis Severity) which is reduced by 1 every 10 ICs. This causes the target to become temporarily bioluminescent so long as they still have Visibility penalties from Taiton, radiating a glow that extends (Severity of Visibility \* 2\) Yards and is always centered on them. This provides a Stealth penalty equal to the size of the light. This counts as a Taiton light source.  
* Taiton is weak to Suiton, but strong against Fuuton and Doton.

### **Photonic Infusion**

The most sensitive and gifted of the Asashi have learned not only to generate and manipulate light, but to absorb it as well. Consuming the photonic energy and turning it into Chakra to fuel themselves and their brilliant powers. This is technically something all Asashi perform automatically due to their altered biology, in fact, it is the reason why they can perform what they can do. But those skilled enough can absorb some the excess energy produced by the inefficiency of their own Taiton Techniques, that being some of the visible light that makes their attacks visible (Which, had it not existed, their attacks would have been completely invisible, thank the ninja gods they can't control light to THAT extent). After absorbing and digesting this excess light, they release it into a small twinkling star that'll float around them until they use its energy up in another strike.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 5  
Scale: 5  
Limit: CHA/30, max of 3\.

Effects: 
You can store Twinkling Stars up to your ranks in this ability. You may choose to add one of the following when you perform any Taiton Ninjutsu:

Absorption: Immediately after using a Taiton Ninjutsu you channel the excess energy into a star that hovers around you until spent. It has a rank equal to the jutsu cast. When you gain a star while you are at your cap you may either discard the lowest ranking star or fuse 2 stars of the same rank creating one of the next higher rank.

Infusion: You supplement any Taiton Ninjutsu with the energy stored in a star. Upon declaration you may either reduce the chakra cost of the jutsu by the star’s rank or increase your chakra exhaustion roll by twice the rank of the star.

### **Bunsan Hikari No Jutsu \- Dispersing Gleam Technique**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- Taiton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 18  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10

Effects: You create a small orb of pure light in the spot you are standing on which will remain there so long as you maintain the Upkeep of this Technique. This orb radiates a light which extends to CHA/10 Yards and counts as a Taiton light source. You may, at any time, drop the Upkeep of this Technique as a Speed 2 Interrupt, and transform into a beam of light that instantly teleports to the orb. Ignoring any movement based penalties or ground based/environmental effects in the path. Before then transforming back. If this is done after an enemy has declared an action but before that action has fully resolved, then they may abort the action without paying any Stamina/Chakra Cost. Though they still pay any Speed or AP spent on the Action.

### **Taiton: Akenomyōsei \- Solar Release: Morning Star**

(Flavor Text)

Type: B Rank \- Katon Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 32  
Upkeep: Special  
Damage: (X \* 2)d20.Open(12)  
Area: X \* 3  
Speed: 18  
Seal Speed: 21  
Special: Visibility (X/2) for 50 ICs, Ignite (X), and Burn (X \* 2\)

Effects: X has a max of CHA/5 and is based off of the Special Upkeep of this Technique. You create a mass of searing hot light right above your head, this Star is small at first, but it rapidly begins absorbing energy from both the sun and you. Growing larger, hotter, and brighter with each passing moment. You do not immediately perform an attack when you use this Technique, instead you gain a Special Upkeep which starts at 1 and cannot be reduced or negated. Every 3 ICs that pass, the Special Upkeep increases by 1\. So long as this Technique’s Upkeep is maintained, the entire battlefield is considered to be lit up by a Taiton light source. You may at any point choose to end the Upkeep, in which case the Star will descend down and destroy everything in its Area centered on the spot where the Technique was originally started. This Technique always uses Speed 18 for the purpose of Damage calculations.

If this is transformed into a Taiton Technique. You absorb the energy of the Star when you drop the upkeep, and then proceed to shoot it into a giant laser that decimates everything it's directed towards. Its Area becomes a (Area/2) Yard wide, (Area \* 2\) Yard long beam of pure light originating from the spot where you are currently standing. And it uses double the Area for the percentage of extra damage that is applied to HP.
