# **Ranged Weapons**

Ranged Weapons will have one or more of the following Tags, these Tags determine the type of damage the item inflicts, how many hands are needed to use them, their size and any other special characteristics it may possess. Even if the Tag does not have any specific rules, it’s there because an Ability or a Jutsu might apply to weapons with such a Tag.

* Small: Weapon Category.  
* Large: Weapon Category.  
* Exotic: Weapon Category.  
* Slashing, Piercing, Blunt: Damage Type Category. This determines what type of Wound the weapon inflicts. If a Weapon has more than one Damage Type, you must choose which one you are using when declaring an attack.  
* Thrown: These weapons are made to be thrown, their Range will be listed in the properties. Drawing a Thrown weapon is a Speed 0 action. You do not need to declare how many you draw, only which specific weapon you are drawing. This means you can usually skip declaring a Draw action and simply declare your attack. The only times when this will be an issue is if your opponent can somehow Interrupt you at any time (suck as with a Sneak Attack) or when you need to wait for your opponent's reaction before executing an attack (such as Uchiha’s Senchigan).  
* Melee: The weapon can also be used as a Melee weapon, it will list what Tags it uses in the Effect section. Refer to Melee weapons for descriptions on these tags.  
* Ammunition: These weapons are used as ammunition for another weapon, they cannot be used on their own.

## **Small**

### **Kunai \[Piercing, Thrown, Melee\]**

One of the two mainstays of ninja armed combat, the kunai is a small metal knife, shaped like an elongated diamond. On the short end it has a handle just long enough to wrap one's hand around, typically wrapped in cloth to improve the grip, and a metal ring on the end of that.

Cost: 300  
Speed: 8  
Stamina: 8  
Damage: 2d6  
Range: 5 \+ STR/4  
Delay: 2

Special: When used as Melee Weapons they have the following Tags: Piercing, Slashing, Small, One-Handed, Dual. 

### **Shuriken \[Slashing, Thrown\]**

The other classic ninja weapon, even more famous than the kunai, shuriken are small, flat four-pointed metal stars thrown at opponents to distract and mildly injure them. Like kunai, shuriken are black, making them less reflective and generally harder to spot in low-light conditions.

Cost: 300  
Speed: 5  
Stamina: 5  
Damage: 1d6  
Accuracy: \+2  
Range: 5 \+ STR/4  
Delay: 2

### **Senbon \[Piercing, Thrown\]**

Large metal needles, traditionally used in acupuncture. Rarely, particularly skilled shinobi will use these with devastating efficiency. Frequently, particularly overconfident shinobi will use this with depressing ineptitude.

Cost: 500  
Speed: 10  
Stamina: 5  
Damage: 1d4  
Accuracy: \-2  
Range: 5 \+ STR/5  
Delay: 3

Special: Ignore armor. Cannot be used in Multi Throw (See Abilities).

## **Large**

### **Fuuma Shuriken \[Slashing, Thrown, Melee\]**

A fairly complex device, a fuuma shuriken is four curved blades that can fold together and be used as an improvised blade in melee combat, or unfolded and locked open, taking on a pinwheel shape, to be thrown.

Cost: 10000  
Speed: 14  
Stamina: 15  
Damage: (4+STR/12)d12  
Range: STR/3  
Delay: 4

Special: For every point you hit by, you add 10% to the attack's total damage, to a maximum of \+200% (so, if they dodged and you hit by 3 points you'd do 1.3 times damage, and that number would be reduced by the effects of partial defense); this does not apply if it is blocked. If no defense is declared then the attacker hits by their full accuracy value. This weapon's damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds. You may also use the Fuuma Shuriken as a melee weapon, in which case it loses all of its other special effects, deals only 4d12 damage and has the following Tags: Slashing, Small, One-Handed.Because these are large and encumbering, they are typically worn somehow strapped to the back; for each Fuuma Shuriken beyond the first you are carrying you have a \-1 penalty to dodge rolls.

## **Exotic**

### **Bow, Daikyu**

A large bow, generally bigger than its wielder at six feet or so high. The upper 'half' is actually 2/3 or so of the total length. As most ninja find these near-useless in combat, they tend to see more use in assassination missions.

Cost: 25000  
Speed: 20  
Stamina: 20  
Damage: (STR/8) dice; die size determined by arrow  
Range: STR  
Accuracy: \-10  
Delay: 6

Special: The bow uses double your damage bonus. Using a bow always takes two hands. You may take a Speed 10 Aim action which gives the attack \+4 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. If you have to take any action which requires movement (including dodging), you lose the benefits of your aim.

### **Bow, Yumi**

Technically, it's called a hankyu, and kyudo practitioners would be horribly offended to hear shinobi calling all bows of this sort 'yumis'. However, ninja hardly care\! The yumi is a much smaller bow, typically not more than four feet long.

Cost: 15000  
Stamina: 15  
Damage: (STR/10) dice; die size determined by arrow  
Range: STR /2  
Speed: 14  
Accuracy: \-8  
Delay: 4

Special: The bow uses 1.5 times your damage bonus. Using a bow always takes two hands. You may use a Speed 8 Aim action which gives the attack \+3 Accuracy. You may Aim up to twice for a single attack. You may dodge while Aiming, though this increases the Speed of your Dodge action by 3\.

### **Arrow \[Piercing, Ammunition\]**

These are necessary to use a bow in combat\! Specifically, arrows are the ammunition for bows, and each attack you make with a bow requires you to use an arrow. Arrows can usually be retrieved after battle.

Arrows are expensive not because of their construction, but because ones of the quality that chakra-using ninja need are hard to come by; shuriken and kunai are competitively mass produced, arrows are not.

Cost: 5000  
Damage: d12

### **Arrow, Piercing \[Piercing, Ammunition\]**

Arrows with narrow steel tips that excel in penetrating armor and the like. These ignore the effects of enemy armor when dealing damage, but lose something in terms of killing power due to creating smaller wounds.

Cost: 5000  
Damage: d8  
Special: Ignore armor.
