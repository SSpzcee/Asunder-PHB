## **Kidosei**

### **Jūryoton \- Gravity Release**

**All Kidosei start with 1 less Unique Point and begin with the Elemental Aptitude for Earth and Wind. They also have Elemental Affinity: Shakuton, which includes Doton and Fuuton.** 

Any Doton or Fuuton technique may be converted to Jūryoton, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra Cost  
* Jūryoton always deals blunt damage.  
* Jūryoton techniques with a Range can be used against targets NDB Yards farther than their normal range.   
* Jūryoton receives a +(CHA/30) Accuracy Bonus to a max of jutsu rank.   
* Whenever you perform a Jūryoton Damage-Dealing Jutsu, choose whether it increases or decreases the Mass of the target before the Attack is defended against. If the attack hits, the Mass of the target is increased/decreased by Rank of Jutsu (1 for E Rank, 3 for C Rank, etc...).  
* Jūryoton cannot Increase/Decrease a person's Mass beyond 2+(CHA/10).  
* Doton transformed Jūryoton Techniques do not apply Immobilization or Stun. Instead, they add or increase existing Knockback by a value equal to the highest of the Technique's Stun * 2 or Immobilization * 3. For Ground-Based Techniques, the Knockback instead sends them flying into the air, wherein they begin falling a distance of 3 Yards every 1 IC (which cannot be increased or reduced) until they hit the ground. The Target cannot perform any movement action(such as Shushin or Blink) until they fall back to the ground. Once they hit the ground, they take 5 times the Yards fallen this way in Blunt Damage. Fuuton’s Wind Release Stream can prevent this damage but doubles its duration.    
* Fuuton transformed Jūryoton Techniques cannot be used with a fan.  

### **Mass**

You have been infused with the paradoxical chakra of the Kidōsei, which greatly alters your connection to the gravitational pulls of the world, either weakening the world's pull on you, or strengthening it. Mass starts at 0 (Which technically everybody is normally at) and can be decreased or increased beyond that value, becoming Negative Mass or Positive Mass providing the effects below:

Positive: For every 1 Mass your damage bonuses are increased by 0.5 for the purposes of dealing damage.  For every 2 Mass movements (including through forced movement like knockback), that amount is reduced by 5\%. For every 3 Mass the Speed of all your Actions and Interrupts are increased by 1 except for Search (And other Actions similar to Search). 

Positive: For every \-1 Mass your damage bonuses are decreased by 0.5 for the purposes of dealing damage.  For every 2 Mass movements (including through forced movement like knockback), that amount is increased by 5%. For every 3 Mass the Speed of all your Actions and Interrupts are increased by 1 except for Search (And other Actions similar to Search). 

The speed of all actions cannot be increased more than half its base speed (rounded up) through this status effect. If Negative Mass is applied to somebody who already has Positive Mass, their original status would move towards 0 until it reaches the other threshold, and vice versa. Every 15 ICs, your Mass severity is moved towards 0 by 1 until it equalizes.

### **Mitsushenka \- Density Shift**

(Flavor Text)

Type: D Rank \- Jūryoton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: X \* 2  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10

Effects: X has a maximum of CHA/10. You Increase or Decrease your own Mass from 0 by X when you perform this technique, acquiring the appropriate effects for your final Mass status. You may perform a Speed 5, Chakra Y \* 2 Action to change your Mass once again, where Y is the difference between your Current and New Mass , changing your Upkeep depending on how much above or below 0 your new Mass is. However, as a Kidosei, your body is naturally attuned to the forces holding the world together, and experiences far stronger changes than others.   
For every stack of Positive Mass you possess, your body becomes more Dense, and far harder to break. You receive your (Positive Mass \* 5) in DR. If your Positive Mass becomes 5 or greater through this technique, then you become so Dense that you attain your own gravitational pull. Everybody within CHA/2 yards of you is dragged (Positive Mass/4) yards towards you every IC they are within range.  

For every stack of Negative Mass you possess, your body becomes less Dense, and far easier to maneuver with. You receive your (Negative Mass/3) as a Bonus to Dodge. If your Negative Mass becomes  \-5 or greater through this technique, then your Density has been lowered to such an extent that your atoms begin to freely move away from each other. You begin to hover 1 yard off the ground (And all liquids) as you become as light as air, this gives you immunity to any ground based environmental effects such as Syrup Capture Field.  You can phase and pass through any non-chakra reinforced stationary object that is less than 1 foot thick.

### **Tsunagu Kūsho \- Tether to the Void**

With a flick of their fingers the Kidosei are able to bend the natural forces of gravity to their will. creating a significant 1 inch large tear in space-time (Yes, that is actually quite a big hole in the context of literal space and time) that pulls any and all things towards it with an impossibly strong suction force. This feat may seem effortless and rather underwhelming to those peering at it from a distance, as from the outside it only seems like a tiny hole dragging things towards it at a snail-like pace. However, this is one of the clan's most lethal traps, and proof of their fearsome powers. As once somebody has the misfortune of accidentally stepping too close to this tear in space. They will realize its nature is that of an all consuming singularity capable of tearing apart the cells off of their body one by one as they slowly disappear into the void.

Type: C Rank \- Jūryoton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 16  
Range: CHA/2  
Area: 10  
Speed: 9  
Seal Speed: 13  
Upkeep: 4

Effect: Choose a 1x1 yard spot within Range of this technique. the fabric of space in that spot constricts upon itself, creating a Singularity. This causes a strong gravitational force that pulls everything within the Area centered on that Singularity (CHA/100) yards into its center every IC. Every IC spent inside of the Singularity (The actual spot this Jutsu initially Targeted), they take NDB damage that cannot be mitigated as their bodies are crushed and torn apart at the same time. This Singularity lasts for 50 ICs before the tear in Space-Time finally fixes itself, ending the Technique.

### **Mugen No Gyakuten \- Limitless Reversal**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- Jūryoton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 22  
Upkeep: 6  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 15

Effects: Upon activating this technique, you bend the fabric of space to such an extent that distances get twisted and distorted around you. You are still, technically, in that same spot, but to others it looks as if the distance between you and them has stretched.  
Anybody that targets you with a Ranged attack while you have this technique active treats you as if you are NDB Yards further than you actually are.  Attacks with an Area are not exempt from this, if an AoE Attack covers the spot you are technically standing on, but does not have enough of a Range to cover the extra distance created by this technique, then you are exempt from the effects of the attack, including damage. However, continuous Area or terrain effects such as Earth Prison Dome or Syrup Capture Field will still affect you. Taijutsu Attacks, even done in Melee range, must declare a "Move with an Attack" that covers the distance created by this technique, or else the attack will not reach you. Anybody targeting you may pay an extra X amount of Chakra or Stamina, depending on the cost of their attack, to cover an (X \* 2\) amount of the extra distance they need to reach you (They still need to cover the real distance normally).

### **Seiun Haaku \- Nebular Grasp**

Your manipulation of graviton particles has lots of potential uses\! All of the following have a Chakra 15 cost, and are considered to be E-Ranked Jūryoton Ninjutsu effects:

* When throwing weapons (either as part of a Jutsu or as a Multi-Throw) you may use CHA/8 in place of DEX/10 to determine how many you can throw. And you may use your NDB instead of PDB.   
* You may, as a Speed 8 Action, increase or decrease the weight of any inanimate object not worn or carried by CHA pounds. You can perform this multiple times on the same object changing it's weight by a maximum of CHA\*5 (tracking past 0). If you lower an object by more then its weight then it becomes weightless, it starts to float 1 Yard off the ground (Provided there are no other objects on top of it) and requires zero effort to move it around. Every IC the effect begins to fade returning the objects weight back to it's normal amount by 1% of the objects original weight.   
* As a speed 10 Action you can shift the weight of weapons wielded by someone. You increase or decrease their weapons weight by 25% to a maximum of 100%. Every 25% increase to weight increases its delay and DB by 1 while using the weapon. And every 25% decreases it's delay and DB by 1 while using the weapon. This effect can only target a single weapon and lasts 30 IC from the last time the weapon was targeted.  
* You can retrieve, as a Speed 4 action, any discarded objects or used projectiles within CHA/4 yards, bringing them to yourself.

## **Tekketsu**

The Tekketsu are a clan that had long settled in the area that is now known as Iwagakure much like the Kidosei and were even drawn to the same impact event they were. The Tekketsu are a clan with much more mundane, but no less extraordinary artisan prowess and tradition whose works are sometimes lauded as divine. Even from birth a Tekketsu is gifted in the sense of construction, academy children able to rival adults in engineering and metalcraft and thus they don't really specialize in their trade. For they are all as easy as the next. Additionally as a consequence of working with metal so much, the Tekketsu gravitated towards weapons as their main martial art. Their warrior tradition was simple, but it heavily emphasized the connection between a weapon and its maker. Tekketsu wielding their own blades often have a supernatural proficiency with them, despite there being little difference in ability or power when wielded by a layman.

**Tekketsu start with the Elemental Aptitude and Elemental Affinity for Doton.**

### **Living Furnace**

The fame and legend of Clan Tekketsu comes primarily from their mystical connection to metal, raw or manufactured. And their unmatched ability to shape it into arms and armor of peerless quality. The  actual truth regarding their talent, however, is a guarded secret (Though one that many of those with real power across the Ninja World have, more or less, figured out). That truth being that those born of the Tekketsu bloodline are able to absorb minerals into their body, and manipulate them to a limited degree within themselves. This allows them to purify metals, shape them, and turn them into a worked product all inside their body, without the help of a proper forge. Producing results that can even surpass that of most traditional craftsmen.  
Type: Ability  
Cost: 25  
Scale: 0  
Limit: 1

Effect: You can store up to (RES/2) KGs of rocks, minerals, and crystals within your body without any visible evidence that you are carrying anything as a Speed 15, Delay 15\. The added weight will not affect you at all either. Nor will anybody ever be able to notice you are carrying these minerals (Even through special sensory capabilities).  
Additionally, so long as MOST of a weapon, gear, or piece of armor is made of worked metal (Too much wood or cloth and the such causes you terrible indigestion issues), you can absorb and store any object you touch or are carrying/wearing within yourself as a Speed 5, Delay 5 Action. You may only have a combined total of (RES/20) Weapons and/or Armor stored within you, and an additional storage of (RES/4) for metal Throwing Weapons and Arrows, and other metallic Gear. When you wish to, you may instantly eject the object from within you as a Speed 0 Action and hold it in your hand. This may also be used alongside an Interrupt, allowing you to produce and hold any Weapon or object you had stored as part of an Interrupt.

You may craft Weapons and Armor without the aid of any tools or a forge. Additionally, so long as a piece of armor is stored inside of you, it will naturally regenerate 20% of its Maximum Durability every OOC day. And a broken Weapon will naturally repair itself after 7 OOC days.

### **Prodigious Smith**

Due to their long held secret techniques, traditions and natural aptitude as craftsmen, Tekketsu automatically gain both the Weaponsmithing and Armorsmithing specializations when they put a Skill Point in the Artisan Skill for the first time. And their Ranks in Artisan counts for both specializations. 

### **Advanced Metallurgy**

The world, and Earth Country especially, are full of many unique and wondrous materials hidden deep beneath the earth. But few are ever able to beat these special rocks and metals into something usable, fewer still are truly able to capitalize on their unique properties. And only the Tekketsu, with their nearly supernatural connection to the forge, are able to strengthen those properties to create weapons and pieces of armor worthy of legend. The Tekketsu jealously guard the techniques they use to forge these incredibly rare metals, and rarely ever trade a finished product outside of the Clan. If they ever do, then it is done as a gesture of love and goodwill meant only for the closest people to the Tekketsu, in such cases, the armor or weapon is rarely exchanged for money and is typically handed out for free as a symbol of the Tekketsu's wish for that particular individual to remain safe and protected. Lucky few are the ones so beloved by a Tekketsu. While the clan typically frowns on selling works created with their specially harvested materials and secret techniques, such symbolic gestures are deeply respected and accepted by the Clan.

Type: Ability  
Cost: 5  
Scale: 5  
Limit: 1+Artisan/10, Max 6

Effect: For each Rank taken in this Ability, you unlock one of the Wondrous Materials listed below, becoming able to utilize that material in the place of common steel to craft your weapons and armor with. Each Wondrous Material has special properties which change slightly in effect based on whether it's a weapon or armor they're being used for, and a cost modifier that multiplies the final cost of the Weapon or Armor being made. 

You are only ever able to use one specific Wondrous Material for each Weapon or Armor you create. And note that Wondrous Materials can never be used to create Mobile Armor, as that type of armor does not utilize much metal. Only Protective and Encased Armor can benefit from this Ability. 

#### **Skysteel:**

A silvery blue metal named for its miraculous lightness which has been described as "light as a cloud". Although it can be (And often is, by the untrained eye) easily mistaken for common tin ore at a glance in its unworked state, it is anything but. Far lighter than any steel alloy, while being just as durable, allows the Tekketsu to forge Weapons and Armor out of Skysteel that are just as strong as their steel counterparts, while being far lighter. Anything made from this metal has a soft, blue sheen to it. And, with the right forging techniques applied, can even be made to appear as blue as the sky.   
Weapon Effect: The Delay of Jutsus or Attacks used with the Weapon is halved.  
Armor Effect: The Armor-Based Immobilization penalty of this Armor is reduced by \-1.  
Cost Modifier: 1.75

#### **Ironheart:**

Few metals are as hard as Ironheart, and of those, none possess the necessary qualities to forge usable Armor or Weapons. They're either too brittle, too heavy, can't maintain an edge, etc. Yet no such shortcomings exist with Ironheart, an incredibly dense and dark metal that is used to craft some of the toughest Weapons and Armor known in the world. Its hardness has obvious benefits when it comes to making protective gear, yet even for weaponry there is use as Ironeart is so hard that it can easily cut or break through anything softer than itself (which is nearly everything).

Weapon Effect: Your weapon cannot break. And it ignores half of target's DR and Armor Absorption, Armor Durability takes three times the Damage it would normally take.

Armor Effect: Increases Armor's Base Durability by 200\.  
Cost Modifier: 1.75

#### **Voidglass:**

Said to be the byproduct of the meteorites that struck the land now known as Earth Country, whose alien qualities caused the birth of the Kidosei Clan (Supposedly), and therefore, the birth of Iwagakure as a whole. These ethereal shards of violet obsidian possess mystical properties that interact with any current of Elemental Chakra which comes in contact with it, disrupting and absorbing it.

Weapon Effect: This weapon can Parry Projectile Ninjutsu Attacks. 

Armor Effect: This armor's Absorption is treated as twice its normal value against Ninjutsu Attacks. This armor's Durability only takes half damage against such Attacks.  
Cost Modifier: 2

#### **Crypstone:**

When thousands of lives are lost upon a battlefield, the embers of the fallen's lifeforce and the anguished emotions of their final moments are absorbed by the earth beneath. Coalescing slowly over the process of many years into the stone until you get what is known as Crypstone. A cursed grey stone that is closely associated with death, and whose presence is often believed by the superstitious to bring ill luck. Even those with no sensitivity to Chakra can sense its maligned nature. Due to these supestitions, and the rarity for the right conditions for its creation to occur, this is one of the rarest materials to acquire. Yet despite its rarity, and the cursed nature of Crypstone that makes the skin of those holding it crawl, the Tekketsu still work with it to forge their arms and armor. As they are able to draw out that cursed energy and refine it to bring that curse of death upon their enemies  
Weapon Effect: This weapon reduces the Target's Maximum Vitality (Or HP, if Current Vitality is 0\) by 10% of the Attack's Damage, this also affects Wound Thresholds. The reduction to Maximum Vitality/HP does not disappear until an hour has passed.  
Armor Effect: When this armor is struck with a Melee Attack, and the enemy's Attack's Damage is enough to deal Wound to its Wearer, the enemy also receives a Piercing Minor Wound within the same location.  
Cost Modifier: 2.5

#### **Angelskin:**

A silvery metal with the consistency and malleableness of dough, Angelskin was originally only used for extremely rare and valuable jewelry due to its beautiful sheen and its almost feather-like texture (Which is where the name came from). That is, until the Daimyo's wife of Lightning Country accidentally cut a finger while tending to her rose garden, and blood from the cut trailed over the Angelskin ring she was wearing, causing it to absorb the crimson life force as it suddenly hardened and constricted painfully around her finger. Turning from its beautiful silvery sheet to an abyssal black that reflected no light whatsover. For the next hour, all attempts to remove the ring ended in failure, even the special cutting properties of the Raiton techniques utilized by the Daimyo's Shinobi bodyguard were no match for the now hardened Angelskin. Yet, just when the Daimyo's wife thought she might end up losing a finger, the ring suddenly returned to its normal color and became incredibly soft again, the blood having fully vaporized by that point and separated from the metal. From that day on, the strange properties of Angelskin became widely known, making it as valued as it was feared and despised. The Tekketsu actually do not make full arms and armor out of Angelskin, they only include small veins of the substance into an alloy with regular steel, imparting to the steel these mystical and ominous properties.

Weapon Effect: This weapon absorbs half of the highest Bleed Status Condition that the Target is suffering from, and gains a stacking \+1% to its Wounding bonus per Bleed Stack absorbed this way. This bonus lasts until the end of Combat.

Armor Effect: This armor gains a +1\% bonus to its Absorption every time it’s wearer has their bleed status reduced to a maximum of 25\%. This lasts until the end of the fight. As a Speed 5 action the wearer may give themselves a Bleed status equal to 1 \+ half the \% bonus provided by this armor piece.  
Cost Modifier: 1.5

#### **Mindglass:**

Not to be mistaken for Voidglass, Mindglass is a translucent crystal which glows with swirling multi-colored hues when put under light. It is only found in extremely small quantities at the bottom of oceans in regions known for their extreme volcanic activity, making it perhaps the hardest and rarest mineral to harvest in the world. And yet, many individuals still risk life and limb to acquire it because select groups like the Tekketsu Clan are willing to pay several times its weight in gold for its mystical effects on the mind when one's body is in close proximity to enough of the substance. In its base crystalized form, it simply causes a tingling sensation within one's mind upon touching it, but with the right forging techniques which are only known to the Tekketsu, one is able to refine that property to either reinforce one's mental faculties, or disrupt them entirely.

Weapon Effect: If this weapon strikes somebody that has an Upkeep, then that Target's concentration will be disrupted, causing them to roll a Resistance Check against a TN equal to Target's combined Upkeep value times five. If they fail, then all Upkeeps end prematurely.

Armor Effect: This armor keeps the wearer's mind clear and calm by absorbing the negative mental energy onto itself. Every time the wearer would be affected by a Genjutsu (Before they roll Gen Defense), this armor loses 100 Durability and the wearer becomes able to roll Genjutsu Defense twice and use the higher result.  
Cost Modifier: 2.25

### **Sunderer**

Type: Ability  
Cost: 10  
Scale: 15  
Limit: Artisan/10, Max 3

Effect: Whenever the Tekketsu performs a Melee Weapon Attack against an armored Target (And hits an armored location), after the Armor's Absorption reduces the Damage received by the target, multiply the damage that the Armor is meant to take to its Durability by \+100% per Every Rank in this Ability

### **Tetsue \- Iron Diet**

(Flavor Text)

Type: C Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 16  
Speed: 5  
Requires: Living Furnace Ability

Effect: The Speed of this Jutsu can't be reduced below a 4 by any means. This Jutsu may only be used against Doton and metal/stone Weapon Attacks, Roll your Taijutsu Parry with a \+3 Bonus. If you succeed your Parry Check, then you proceed to successfully absorb the Attack.   
For Doton, you negate any Effects the Attack had and reduce the Total Damage you'd have taken by 75%. This counts as absorbing (NDB of enemy's Jutsu) KGs of rocks and minerals for the sake of the Living Furnace Ability, if you ever end up possessing more stored rocks and minerals than you can absorb, then you automatically fail to absorb that particular Doton Jutsu, no matter the result of the Parry Check.  
In the case of a Weapon Attack, you proceed to Absorb the weapon of the enemy itself, you take only 50% of the Attack's Total Damage and negate any additional effects of the Attack. If the enemy's Weapon is Melee instead of a Projectile. Then the enemy's weapon only becomes partially absorbed into your body, and both of you must roll a Contested Resistance vs their Athletics Check. If you fail, then they quickly pull their weapon out and maintain hold of it. If you succeed, then you successfully proceed to disarm them and absorb their weapon into your body. 

# **Soma** 

It is unknown to outsiders what really is the origin of the Soma and their horrific looking bodies. There have been guesses ranging from supernatural curses to dark, power seeking rituals involving the sacrifice of their own clanmates. The most accepted accurate answer is the result of a widespread fertility treatment that had gone wrong with the succeeding solution being the source of their unique powers.

The women of the Soma are blessed by always birthing twins or more, but these twins do not come out intact. Instead they are conjoined, usually with one being absorbed fully except to the neck up. However, this conjoinment is not a static one as portions of the absorbed twin can seemingly 'grow' out of the primary twin's body.

Soma families train their young ones the ability to grow out their siblings' limbs on command and work together without interfering with each other. With time, the Soma pair not only becomes functional in life but can utilize their twin to unmatched utility in combat, thinking twice as fast, sprouting extra limbs to strengthen themselves physically and even at a moments notice to catch enemies off guard. The more experienced Soma Shinobi can even outgrow their twin to the point that they can separate from each other for a time, resulting in the demise of Shinobi that suddenly get outnumbered by a Soma pair.

### **One Mind, One Body**

They say that two heads are better than one. In the case of the conjoined twins of clan Soma, this saying couldn't be more literal. Problem solving and multi-tasking, scouting and information gathering, to even raw presence on the battlefield. A single pair of Soma twins, despite sharing a single body, could effectively double their capabilities compared to your average Shinobi. However, such a miraculous coordination does not come as naturally to Soma twins as one may assume. The truth that few outside of the Clan know about is that in any given pair of twins, the degree of control they possess over their conjoined body is not equal. There is always a "Primary" head, which possesses majority of the control over their shared body. And then there is the "Secondary" head, which, for a lack of better words, is mostly along for the ride. There are many cautionary tales within the Clan of Primary heads regarding their sibling as nothing but a tool or a slave, rather than an individual with their own thoughts, desires, and dreams. This, understandably, can cause many problems between Twins, problems that can inhibit them from ever reaching their true potential. And so, this has become the truest test in the life of every pair of Twins. Learning to cooperate with one another, to compromise when they have differing beliefs and opinions, and to truly appreciate the special bond that they share. This process goes beyond the simple, and shallow (relative to what the Twins are capable of) trust and coordination that the average person is capable of with somebody that isn't attached to them at the hip (Errr, at the neck, rather). It can take many years, but the most synchronized of the Soma are said to be able to 'access' the thoughts of their sibling, and harmonize with them to such an extent that they truly become One Mind, One Body.

Cost: 5  
Scale: 5  
Limit: XP/750

Effects: The twins gain a \+1 to Research, Awareness, and Athletics rolls per rank in this Ability due to the second head helping in mental and coordination related tasks. Furthermore, the Base Speed of Search (and any actions similar to it, such as Scan) is lowered by 1 per rank in this Ability, to a minimum of 3\. 

In addition, every 25 ICs, the Secondary Sibling is able to to momentarily take control over the Twins' body and perform one Action with a Total Speed of (2 \+ Ranks bought in this Ability) without moving your IC. But any other costs of the Action, such as AP or Fatigue Checks, must still be paid.

### **Tarenken Mo Kogeki \- Multi-Limb Onslaught**

Type: D Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: X\*1.5 Rounded Up.  
Speed: 10  

Effect:  
X has a maximum of 4 plus your ranks in One Mind, One Body. You may generate X number of Vestigial Limbs in any combination of either Arms, or Legs. These Vestigial Limbs are not dexterous enough to use Weapons in any manner, though they may still carry objects (if they are Arms, at least.). And you may, as a Speed 5 Action while this technique is active, choose to increase or decrease the number of Vestigial Limbs you possess, or outright change some or all from Arms to Legs, or vice versa. Changing your Upkeep accordingly. If X ever becomes 0, this technique ends. 

Arm: Every Vestigial Arm you have generated provides a \+1 bonus to Grappling rolls and Seal Speed Reductions  
Leg: Every Vestigial Leg you have generated provides a \+0.5 bonus to PDB and a 5\% Movement bonus

Furthermore, if X is 2 or higher, you unlock a special Multi-Attack ability. This Multi-Attack ability can only be used with basic Unarmed attacks and allows you, up to a max of X, to strike with 1 + X/2 basic attacks at once and behaves like Dual Wielding with the following changes:

The speed (for damage purposes) for each attack is divided by the number of attacks.
This attack has a \-1 accuracy penalty per attack that cannot be reduced by Ambidexterous
The stamina cost is increased by 1/5th the cost of every extra attack rather then 1/3rd
The opponent makes one defense action but rolls separetely for each individual attack
The damage dice of the first attack is reduced by 30\% and every subsequent attack has its damage reduced by 10\% more then the previous. (40, 50, etc)
The speed is increased by 2 per additional attack for IC purposes only 

### **Tarensoma \- Assault of the Twin Demons**

(Flavor Text here)

Type: C Rank \- General Taijutsu  
Stamina: 12  
Speed: 5  
Special: Requires Tarenken Mo Kogeki to be active

Effect: If you miss or only partially hit with an Unarmed or Combo Taijutsu attack, you may perform this technique as an Interrupt before the opponent's defense fully resolves (Ignoring typical Interrupt validity rules). You sacrifice 1 Vestigial Limb as it forcibly creates some form of opening for the rest of your attack to go through, forcing the target(s) of the initial attack to make another Defensive roll of the same type and the same bonuses (though paying no extra cost). If your attack hits this time (Whether partial or not), you deal one less instance of damage, though still use the same divided and Total Speeds as before. And you lower X for Tarenken Mo Kogeki by 1\.  

You may use this technique several times on the same attack until you fully hit, or no longer have any Vestigial Limbs to sacrifice.

### **Rikon \- Divorce**

Type: B Rank \- General Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 20   
Stamina: 20   
Upkeep: 10  
Speed: 15, Delay 20  
Special: Requires 2 Vestigial Legs and 2 Vestigial Arms, and 1 Willpower.

Effects: 
By sacrificing 1 Willpower and ending "Tarenken Mo Kogeki" the Twins Separate with the Secondary Sibling taking control of those limbs. This creates a Vestigial Body that cannot act until the delay ends.

When Separating, the Twins halve their Current and Maximum Vitality, HP, and AP pools (Rounding Down). But still share the same Willpower pool and use their unhalved Wounding Thresholds \-20\%. When they Merge back together, combine their new values once again (Your Maximums for each go back to what they were before being Rounded Down).

The secondary sibling becomes an identical clone to the original with all the same combat stats and features except for Capability Talents. They are added to the initiative 1 IC after the delay ends and share the same fatigue level and wounds as the main body when it was created. You may transfer any equipment from yourself to this clone as part of its creation. Additionally the clone also gains the upkeep from this technique.

Both the Primary and Secondary Sibling lose access to all other Soma jutsu and abilities, but whenever the Twins perform a Simultaneous Action using the same Jutsu, they both gain a \+2 ACC bonus to the technique and increase their Total Damage by 20\%.

Either Sibling may perform a Merge if they are within 1 Yard of the other Sibling. This is a Speed 10, Delay 10 Action. During which the Secondary Sibling is still targetable until the Delay fully resolves. Any wounds and statuses are transferred to the main body.

If either Sibling is incapacitated, their body collapses into a gelatinous puddle of flesh and instantly merges into the other body. Merging while one of the Siblings is unconscious causes the Twins to receive a Stun 20. However, the unconscious Sibling will wake up immediately after and you regain access to all of your Soma jutsu and Abilities.

# **Yogani** 

It was stated that many years ago, during the Warring States period, when Iwagakure was initially established, the residents chose a Jinchuuriki of the Four Tails. He lived through the first Shinobi World War, and as a token of Son Goku's gratitude, the Four Tails bestowed upon him the ability of a Bijuu, namely a Kekkai Genkai. The Person's name has been lost to time, but Iwagakure recognizes them as the Yogani Clan's progenitor. Despite numerous setbacks, the Yogani have remained steadfast pillars of Iwagakure over time alongside the Kidosei. Under their new Tsuchikage, they saw a lot more recreational uses for themselves in joint partnership with the Tekketsu, and most recently, the Tesso had been commissioned to further push the industrialization of Iwa.   
They often found themselves, serving as counselors as well as helping to carve out the tunnel system and mine resources, similar to their fellow earthbound comrades, The Tesso Clan, ensuring stability among the people of Iwagakure. The Yogani are usually known to be hardy, haughty, and headstrong. The Yogani are a clan that greatly values strength above all else, and they hold the powers of the violent, molten earth to be the strongest of all forces. 

They often find themselves training their bodies around the pressures of the underground and harsh environments of Magma. This training has resulted in their bodies being a bit more resistant to fire and a bit more resilient than others. 

**Yogani start with 1 less Unique Point and begin with the Elemental Aptitude for Fire and Earth. They also have Elemental Affinity: Yoton, which includes Katon and Doton.**

### **Heat Resistance**

Your average Yogani has spent years deep in the heart of the earth living, working, and training besides flowing rivers of magma. This, alongside their natural physiology has made the Yogani highly resistant to fire. 

Base: 5  
Scale: 3  
Limit: 1+RES/20

Effects: The Yogani reduce any Ignite, or Ignite like effects (such as Blaze), that they take by 1 per rank in this Ability. Furthermore, the first time you take this, you gain the ability to touch any small to medium sources of fire without burning yourself (such as torches, campfires, stoves, furnaces, etc). Besides resisting Ignite better, This does not help in any way against Katon attacks (don't even ask if it can).

### **Yoton \- Lava Release**

Combining earth and fire chakra results in the advanced nature of Yoton, or “Lava Release”; a cataclysmically destructive nature release which involves bringing raging rivers of magma and sulfur from the very cores of the earth to melt your enemies, or creating them yourself.  
Any Doton or Katon Technique may be converted to Yoton, with the following effects:

* \+5 Chakra cost  
* Yoton always deals Energy damage.  
* Yoton damage dealing techniques apply the "Dissolve" Status Effect at a severity of 2 per Rank of the Jutsu, which stacks with itself.  
* Dissolve has a max cap of 10+CHA/6.  
* Yoton techniques have their Base Speed increased by (1+Rank of Jutsu) for all purposes.  
* Katon transformed Yoton techniques do not apply Burn or Ignite, instead all Burn or Ignite apply half their severity as the "Dissolve" status effect.  
* Doton transformed Yoton have \-2 ACC and their Area increased by \+5. Non-Area Doton attacks instead gain an Area of 5 and the appropriate tag.  
* Damage dealing Doton transformed Yoton Techniques do not apply an Immobilization if they had one, instead a puddle of rapidly cooling magma fills their Area. Anybody within the area takes CHA/20 Vitality damage reduction every IC they spend in the magma which cannot be mitigated in any form or way. After 15 ICs have passed, anybody that remains in the Area gains an Immobilization equal to 1+CHA/20  and has a movement speed of 0 as the magma cools into bedrock, trapping them. Though they no longer take any damage from standing in the area. A character can break off the bedrock trapping them as a Speed 5, Delay 5 action. Two different instances of magma pools that overlap do not stack their effects; the earliest instance is applied until it cools down to bedrock.  
* Yoton is weak to Raiton, but strong against Fuuton and Suiton.

### **Dissolve**

You've been coated with the corrosive magma of the Yogani. Your clothes and very skin are literally melting off your body. You'll soon discover that ending up naked will be the least of your worries, as the caustic heat softens your flesh and defenses causing you to become more vulnerable to attacks.  
Your DR is reduced by X \* 2 severity of Dissolve, up to a max of 0\. In addition, you'll take X% more damage from attacks of all sources until Dissolve is removed.  
Dissolve naturally reduces by RES/20 every 20 ICs.  
You can pour X amount of gallons of water on yourself as speed X Action to wash away or cool down the lava, each gallon spent this way removes X \* 2 Dissolve severity. If you have no water, you may use the C ranked Water Creation Technique (Assuming you know it) to pour water on yourself, in which case you add the speed of the jutsu to the action above and pay the appropriate chakra cost.

### **Caustic Passion**

Most of the Yogani's cataclysmic powers come from their simple but terrifying ability to rapidly increase the temperature of any rocky or metallic material to hundreds if not thousands of degrees Celsius (If only they could do it just as easily to people, eh?). Far beyond the melting point of most types of worked steel, let alone sediment and rocks. And while this power requires the disciplined control and application of Jutsus to be of any real use in a fight. It is still something every Yogani is capable of at will from birth. And this raw power still has plenty of uses.  
You can, as a Speed 10, Chakra 5 Action, melt any unoccupied (Not carried or used by anybody) non-Chakra Reinforced (Such as from the Strengthening Seal) metallic or rocky object or material within CHA/2 yards. The size of this object can be no larger than 1 cubic foot. Alternatively, for the same Speed and Chakra costs, may choose to melt, and therefore destroy up to CHA/10 Throwing Weapons and Arrows within your range even if they were in the possession of somebody else. Though if the weapons were hidden, you'll need to discover their existence beforehand to destroy them. This power cannot work on Puppets or the Weapons held by Puppets as they are both considered Chakra Reinforced.

### **Lava Release: Gates of Brimstone**

(Flavor Text)

Type: D Rank \- Yoton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: \+4, \+1 per rank of Jutus  
Speed: \+2  
Seal Speed: \+4

Effects: This may be used alongside a Damage-Dealing Yoton Technique, increasing its costs and Seal Speed accordingly.  
Your Yoton attacks release a sulfuric ash. This ash covers an Area of (3 \+ 3 yards per Rank of offensive Jutsu) originating from where the attack landed and which lasts for (5 \+ 5 per rank of the Jutsu) ICs. The sulfuric ash is highly caustic, even contact with the skin is enough to cause searing pain and sap the victim's ability to fight. Normally, this pain is bearable for your average shinobi, but it becomes much worse if their skin was already damaged. Such as from, say, a Yogani's magma melting it off and leaving raw, pink flesh behind.  
Every 5 ICs spent inside the sulfuric ash you take 5 \+ (Dissolve Severity) in damage, which may be mitigated with DR. Additionally, every 15 IC that someone spends in the ash applies a Suffocation of Severity 1 to them. If two instances of Gates of Brimstone overlap, their effects do not stack, use the earliest instance instead.

### **Lava Release: Nine Hells Erupting Armageddon**

Type: B Rank \- Katon Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 32  
Upkeep: Special  
Damage: 18D20.open(9)  
Range: Special  
Area: 10  
Speed: 15, Delay 15  
Seal Speed: 19  
Special: Burn 12, Ignite 12

Effects: You cause 3 spots in the battlefield that are no less than 20 yards away from each other to erupt into miniature volcanos of either flames or molten magma. Each of these eruptions is treated as its own attack that must be defended against individually. For the sake of techniques such as "Smokescreen" or "Gates of Brimstone" each chosen spot creates its own instance of that technique, though you only pay the cost for them once, not three times. This technique treats every target’s Dissolve as if it was double its actual value.  
After resolving the initial set of attacks, you may then choose to take on a special Upkeep of 10 which cannot be reduced by any means. So long as that upkeep is maintained, those three chosen spots will erupt again every 15 ICs later at no extra cost to you. These extra eruptions use the ACC used for the initial attack and deal the listed dice damage \+ (Speed\*NDB). The extra eruptions use Speed 15 for the purpose of damage calculations the first time, but for every extra eruption that occurs past the first one, lower the Speed by 5 for the purpose of damage calculations (It remains at 15 for the purpose of defense validation), and the Ignite and Burn by 4\. Once the Speed reaches 0 for damage calculation purposes, this technique ends and you lose the Upkeep.

# **Tesso**

The Tesso are relatively new to the village; they have already learned how to get along well with the Tekketsu and Yogani clans. Together, their efforts typically produce amazing outcomes. Usually, working in tandem is successful. Their unity has bolstered Iwa's sense of pride in their country by enabling them to process, melt, and manufacture weapons. Although they differ in height, they are all somewhat similar to moles due to their mutations though they have lessened over the generations. Previously, the Tesso Clan was a small hamlet of miners who made a living by excavating stone and minerals. When a sudden shake, presumed to be an earthquake, shook the cavern and caused a collapse with some weird pieces of Onyx black stone trickling in before collapsing completely, they just couldn't seem to break the weird stone with normal mining tools. As the leaders of their hamlet gathered, they devised ways to break the stone with enough fiddling with heavier tools. A large piece of the black stone began to burst and let out a wave of oppressive chakra that began to mutate and shape their bodies. Some didn’t survive the mutations, and it left a lot of them confused and traumatized. They realized some grew thick claws.   The ones who survived and realized how much their condition improved even through all the pain, with newfound determination, began to try and dig themselves out of the collapse. It took a full two days with a full team. They recoiled at the sun, their vision deteriorating at an alarming rate, and they began to retreat to caves beneath Iwagakure.They are usually known for being expert trackers, committed ambush fighters, and extraordinary miners, but when they are above ground, their vision is far worse than it is while they are beneath, so they try to operate in the night if possible.   The Tesso are sometimes described as stubborn, hard workers who prefer to get the job done and have little concern about following commands as long as their compensation is adequate. Frugal and efficient. 

**Tesso starts with the Elemental Aptitude and Elemental Affinity for Doton.**

### **Earthbound**

You were practically born underground (or maybe literally for some) and thus have a lot of experience doing things while 6ft under. So maneuvering while underground is slightly less debilitating for you and sensing opponents through the earth is practically child's play.  

Type: Ability  
Cost: 5  
Scale: 2  
Limit: XP/500, max 5  

When you gain this Ability, you halve the Immobilization and Visibility Status penalties (Rounding Down) provided by the Buried Status or from any Doton sources, and gain a bonus to stealth TNs equal to your Buried Status \* 2.  

Additionally, using Tremorsense no longer has a Chakra Cost for you nor a Seal Speed requirement, and you gain a \-1 Reduction to the Base Speed of Tremorsense and a \+1 to its Search roll per Rank in this Ability.  

### **Badgering Gouge**

Your hands are tipped with extremely thick, very flat, and terrifyingly sharp claws similar to that of a mole. You can also use these claws to dig through the earth at a rate of about five times faster than somebody with tools can. Though this is unfortunately not fast enough to be relevant in a fight.  

Type: Ability  
Cost: 2  
Scale: 2  
Limit: STR/20

Effects: 
You may choose to have your Taijutsu attacks deal slashing damage.  

Additionally as long as you have any Buried Status for every Rank you have in this Ability your Basic Attacks and Taijutsu attacks with the Arm tag deal an extra die of damage and reduce the effectiveness of armor by 5\%. So 3 ranks would provide 3 extra dice and reduce armor by 25\%.  

### **Moguhonmono No Jutsu \- Tunnel Burrowing Rodent Technique**

You begin effortlessly burrowing into the ground with your extremely hard and flat claws and you are still aware of everything that is happening on the surface thanks to your honed tactile senses able to detect even the faintest of vibrations.  

Type: D Rank - Doton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 15 \+ X  
Special Upkeep: 1 \+ X  
Speed: 3 \+ X\*2  

Tags: Utility, Self, Ground-Based  

Effect:  
You descend X Yards below the surface of the earth and gain Buried X to a maximum of 5. You may hide for free as part of this jutsu and as an action while you maintain its upkeep. While stealthed in this way Doton Jutsus do not break your Stealth but instead lower your TN by 5. 

While you maintain the Upkeep for this Technique, you are immune to all Ground-Based and Environmental Effects that don't explicitly extend to underground. You cannot move in any way besides the Move Action, which uses your STR instead of AGI. You can ascend or descend Y Yards as a Speed 3 \+ Y, Stamina 8 \+ Y Yards, where Y is the difference between your current depth and your desired depth.

If you end the Upkeep of this Technique, you ascend back up to the nearest unoccupied spot on the surface. The technique also ends if the durability of the ground above you is reduced to 0.

### **Hōkai Meikai No Jutsu \- Collapsing to the Underworld Technique**

You cause the ground beneath the Target to collapse into a tunnel trapping them below the surface with you.  

Type: C Rank \- Unarmed Taijutsu  
Chakra: 20  
Speed: 14  
Special: Stun 5  

Effect:  
The first time this is used in a fight it's an automatic Sneak Attack. You can only use this Jutsu to target somebody that is directly above you while you are underground. This cannot be Parried or Blocked, only Dodged. If the Target fails, they gain the same amount of Buried Severity as you and you are Clinching your opponent.

When the grapple ends the opponent may immediately escape through the tunnel and end their buried status.

### **Yōshoku Damu No Jutsu \- Cultivating Dam Technique**

You create a giant bowl-like Dam of rock which gradually collects huge boulders inside of it before shattering to cause an avalanche on the poor fools nearby. As more boulders are gathered the bowl grows in size pushing everything in its way except for extremely heavy objects.  

Type: B Rank \- Doton Ninjutsu  
Chakra: 22  
Range: 15  
Cube: X  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 24  

Effect:  
Anything currently present in the Area is shifted to the outer edge of it, but anything weighing over 1 ton prevents this jutsu from being cast in (or extended to) that location. The Dam is empty and can hold up to (CHA\/2) rocks. X begins at 1 and is equal to your Rocks.  

While you are underground and proceed to dig through the earth through Techniques such as Moving Underground as if Swimming or Tunnel Burrowing Rodent Technique, every 1 Yard of earth that you dig through to move is mystically transported as 1 Rock into the Dam, filling it up.  

Once 30 ICs have passed or the Dam is completely filled up, the Dam's walls crack before quickly crumbling apart, causing all Rocks stored within to descend onto the battlefield in a destructive avalanche. This attack uses your Ninjutsu Accuracy at the time that the Dam was originally created, has an area of Cube: X \+ 10, deals Xd20 damage, and does not deal any additional (Speed \* DB) Damage. It cannot be Parried even by Nin Parries due to the sheer mass of the avalanche of rock. Anybody that has something which allows them to ignore Ground-Based Conditions automatically avoids this Attack. Anybody that is hit by this Attack takes the Buried Status of a Severity of X\/5.
