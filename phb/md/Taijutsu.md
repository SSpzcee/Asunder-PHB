Not much to say here. You hit people with your fists, feet, and in all manner of other creative ways. These techniques can stand on their own but contains integral pieces for Combo and Grapple jutsu.

## **Unarmed E-Rank**

### **Deashi Harai: Foot Sweep**

You cause an opponent to fall down by knocking their legs out from under them. Calling it a 'technique' is misleading, but there's more to unbalancing a ninja than just wanting to; it does take at least a little bit of training.

Stamina: 8  
Speed: 4  
Special: \+2 Accuracy
Special: Prone

Tags: 1 Leg

Effects:
If used while in a grapple it gains the following: Takedown, Control 5.

### **Feint**

A subtle trick that almost every ninja knows--and knows how to detect. Still, those that are particularly adept at it are often difficult to defend against properly.

Stamina: X \+ 2  
Speed: X \+ 2

Effect:
This is used alongside any other melee-range Unarmed or Combo Attack, and increases that action's Stamina and Speed by 2 each. Make an opposed Espionage roll; if you beat their result, you've tricked them with your feint. If successful, this triples the Speed of their defensive action for the purpose of determining when they'll act next.

This doesn't prevent it from being a valid Interrupt against your attack.

### **Headbutt**

You use your head to hit someone else's head. Really, honestly, it's a highly technical process. You just don't understand because you're not a ninja.

Stamina: 6
Damage: STR
Speed: 7
Accuracy: \-1
Special: Control 1

Tags: Attack, Melee, Blunt

Effect:  
This always deals a head wound and you must take the final wounding damage, if that would cause you a wound then you gain a head wound of that severity.

When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 1

## **Unarmed D-rank**

### **Teiryuu Dageki \- Halting Blow**

In one smooth motion, the user extends their arm and pushes aside an oncoming blow, steps inward and pulls back their forearm to slam their elbow into the opponent, turning their defense into their offense.

Stamina: 11
Damage: (STR /4)d4  
Speed: 5  
Special: Interrupt, Opener

Tags: 2 Arms

Effects:
Halting Blow is used as an unarmed parry, with a \+3 Accuracy bonus. If you successfully defend, Halting Blow immediately acts as an attack at no extra cost, using the results of your parry roll as its Accuracy and its speed.

Momentum: Parries performed while the Combo is not broken are Speed 1 and have a \+3 bonus to their Accuracy roll. This does not apply to any Jutsu.

### **Senpuu \- Whirlwind**

The user rotates while extending one leg, starting with a high roundhouse that's used partially as a feint. Whether it hits or misses, they continue to rotate into a second spin aimed at the lower part of the body.

Stamina: 15 
Damage: (STR /5)d8  
Speed: 12  
Area: 2
Special: Opener

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this deals 25\% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.

Momentum: Your combo jutsu hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this deals 25\% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20\%.

### **Reppuu \- Gale**

With alarming quickness you drop low to the ground and perform a full 360-degree sweeping kick that knocks opponents off their feet when they attempt to close in for an attack of their own.

Stamina: 13
Damage: (STR /6)d10
Speed: 8
Special: Interrupt, Opener

Tags: 1 Leg

Effects: 
Gale may (but doesn’t require to) be used as an interrupt after you have successfully dodged an attack, targeting the attacker. If Gale is used after a dodge in this fashion, the dodge roll replaces Gale's accuracy.

Momentum: Dodging while the Combo is not Broken is a Speed 1 Interrupt.

### **Dainamikku Entorii \- Dynamic Entry**

This technique is nothing more than a jumpkick at an opponent from hiding. The hiding part became required because of genin's tendency to shout out things like "HIYAH\!" as they did it.

Stamina: 16
Damage: (STR /3)d6
Speed: 12
Special: Requires you be hidden from your target.

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
After the first time Dynamic Entry has been used in combat (by you, by someone else, it doesn't matter) it has a \-6 Accuracy for the rest of that battle.

### **Tokken \- Thrusting Shoulder**

By charging forward and turning at the last moment to bring a shoulder out front, the user slams into the enemy, knocking them back. It relies mostly on the weight of the user, with the expectation they'll be heavier than the person they're running into.

Stamina: 15
Damage: (RES /4)d8
Speed: 12

Tags: 1 Arm

Effects:
This knocks the victim back (your RES)/10 yards.

### **Flash Step**

Stamina: \+X/3  
Speed: \+ X/3  

Tags: Utility, Link

Effect:  
This is used alongside a melee Taijutsu attack, increasing your move with attack X yards to a maximum of the speed of the jutsu.

### **Irimiseme - Entering Attack**
Rather then a direct attack this jutsu involves stepping into close range with an opponent and deflecting a weapon or jutsu by targeting their wrist or elbow.

Stamina: 12
Speed: 4
Tags: Interrupt

Effects:
This may be used to parry any weapon attack or attack ninjutsu performed in melee range. The speed of this interrupt cannot be reduced below 2.

### **Throw**

You use leverage, brute force, or a combination of the two to physically throw an enemy, either by flipping them over you, hurling them into a nearby object, slamming them to the ground, or something similar.

Stamina: 14
Damage: (STR/3)d6
Speed: 8
Accuracy: \-2
Special: Stun 4

Tags: 2 Arms

Effect:
If used while in a grapple it gains the following: Takedown, Control 8

## **Unarmed C-rank**

### **Daisenpuu \- Great Whirlwind**

A more complex version of Senpuu which involves three kicks to the target's body going in the reverse order as before, starting low and going high to end with an axe kick to the opponent's head. The speed and constant rotation is strong enough to actually lift the practitioner into the air during execution.

Stamina: 22
Damage: (STR /5)d12
Speed: 14
Area: 3
Requires: Senpuu
Special: Opener

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, you deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20\%.

Momentum: Your Combo Jutsu have Area 3. Your Combo is not broken as long as at least one person you hit with this Jutsu is a target for the attack. If partial defense applies to your Combo Jutsu, you deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20\%.


### **Tsutenkyaku \- Painful Sky Leg**

After concentrating chakra in the user's legs, they leap high into the air and come down in a destructive axe kick, using gravity to enhance the momentum behind the blow while the user's chakra is used to enhance the destructive force of the blow.

Stamina: 28
Damage: (STR /20)d20
Area: 6
Speed: 16
Special: \-6 Accuracy

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack. Effects of partial hits for this jutsu are extended and deal 10\% per amount they succeed.  

For example on an accuracy 20 attack a defense of: 15-Full Hit, 16-90\%, 17-80\%, 18-70\%, 19-60\%, 20-50\%, 21-40\%, 22-30\%, 23-20\%, 24-10\%, 25-Fully Defended.  

### **Souji Reppuu \- Sweeping Gale**

By flipping forward into a crouch, the user builds momentum that's used to instantly land and begin spinning on one foot, extending the other leg out while using chakra to enhance its density, rotating repeatedly to strike the knees of the enemy, simultaneously evading and tripping them.

Stamina: 21
Damage: (STR /4)d8
Speed: 8
Special: Interrupt, Opener
Requires: Deashi Harai: Foot Sweep, Reppuu

Tags: 2 Leg

Effects:
This follows the rules for the D-rank Reppuu technique (including its Momentum). Should you hit, the opponent is knocked prone.


### **Uchikudakute no Jutsu \- Shattering Hand Technique**

Ninja can perform incredible feats of strength; after years of grueling training, some can literally reduce boulders to gravel for their bare fists. That's a handy trick to have, but most ninja aren't willing to go through the whole 'years of pain and hard work' part, so instead they invented a jutsu which accomplishes a similar effect: by channelling vibrating chakra through their hand at the moment of impact, most solid objects can be shattered with a single blow.

Stamina: 24
Damage: (STR /8)d20
Speed: 13
Delay: 5

Tags: Attack, Blunt, Melee, 2 Arms

Effects:  
Before wounds or damage are calculated, this completely destroys any armor protecting the location it hits.

Against objects this jutsu always does its max damage. If the object is not chakra enhanced nor made of chakra you double its speed for the purposes of dealing damage.

### **Bōshi Riken \- Spinning Backfist**

With a burst of chakra to one of the user's legs, they spin around and extend an arm to knock an opponent senseless with the back of their fist. It's a powerful blow as it uses the weight and momentum of the user's entire body, but has an inherent weakness of losing sight of the enemy while spinning.

Stamina: 26
Damage: (STR /4)d10
Accuracy: \-3
Speed: 10

Tags: 1 Arm

Effects:
This technique's damage is tripled when determining the severity of wounds it inflicts. 

### **Attsu Buchikomu \- Pain Driver**

A brutal technique, and completely inappropriate for training (because someone would have thought it was okay, if we didn't say that). The attacker finds a weak point on their opponent's body, the site of a previous injury, and strikes there to amplify the existing wound.

Stamina: 20
Damage: (STR /3)d4
Speed: 12

Effects: 2 Arms
This attack must be a called shot, and does not normally inflict wounds. Instead, if it targets a location with a Minor Blunt wound, that wound is removed and replaced with a Major Blunt wound on the same location. This only applies if the attack deals damage.

### **Maboroshi Tejun \- Phantom Step**

Despite the fancy name, it's a fairly simple 'technique'. With a momentary burst of energy (and probably adrenaline, considering the circumstances where it's likely to be used) the user does their best to get out of the way of an impending attack. The "phantom" came mostly from the way a shinobi using this can, to the untrained eye, seems to almost disappear. And because ninjas thought it sounded cool.

Stamina: 5 \* X  
Speed: \+X

Effects:
This is used alongside a dodge attempt, increasing its Speed by X and provides it with a \+X bonus. Your dodge's final speed cannot go lower than 2 \+ X.

If combined with the B-rank Leaping Shadow Evasion this technique increases LSE's Stamina cost to (20 \+ 4\*X), which replaces Phantom Step's normal Stamina cost.

### **Chouyaku Kage Kaihi no Jutsu \- Leaping Shadow Evasion Technique**

You leap away from an attack, getting yourself safely out of range. However, you don't pause to regain your orientation and settle into your new position, instead keeping ready to move again.

Stamina: 18
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: 4

Effects:
When you use Chouyaku Kage Kaihi, make a dodge roll. You may automatically attempt to dodge any incoming attacks, without having to take an action to do so, using Chouyaku Kage Kaihi's result as your effective dodge roll. This lasts until you take any action, including defensive interrupts.

### **Ryuorosu - Dragon Takedown**

Adapted--in purpose, method, and name--from a 'normal' style of martial arts, the Dragon Takedown is a more aggressive method of initiating a grapple, often throwing an opponent to the ground in the process.

Stamina: 23
Damage: (STR /3)d6
Speed: 18

Effects:
If you hit, you initiate a clinch with your opponent but you gain a \-5 to your control. Then you may immediately attempt a pin for no cost.

### **No Design, No Conception**

When words and actions are spontaneously the same. You move forwards at the exact same time as your opponent and in doing so throw off their rhythm. Of course, the spontaneous nature of this technique makes it impossible to have any rhythm of your own to attack with, but the practiced shinobi can take advantage of the situation to grab ahold of their opponent.

Stamina: 5 \+ ( 5 \* X )
Special: Interrupt
Speed: \+ X

Tags: 2 Arms

Effects:
X has a maximum of 5. This technique is used alongside any interrupt that requires a defensive roll against an opponent’s Accuracy whilst you are at range 0 with that opponent. You take a penalty of X to your roll, if you successfully defend, No Design, No Conception immediately acts as a Grab at no extra cost, using the results of your dodge roll for its Accuracy and Speed (minimum 3). You gain X Control in the subsequent clinch.

### **Suplex**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex Just... read that, okay? That's what you do to them.

Stamina: 13
Damage: (STR/4)d10
Speed: 15
Accuracy: \-3
Special: Control 5

Tags: Attack, Melee, Blunt

Effects:  
When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 3
 

## **Unarmed B-rank**

### **Kage Buyou \- Shadow of the Dancing Leaf**

The user lowers themself to get underneath their opponent, and then knocks them into the air with a violent rising kick, leaping after them immediately after it to position themselves in the target's shadow.

Stamina: 19
Damage: (STR/4)d10
Accuracy: \+2
Speed: 8
Special: Opener

Tags: 2 Arms

Effects: 
You knock your opponent into the air for 10 IC and they gain the prone condition.

Momentum: If used as the Opener of a Combo, All Combo Jutsus will gain the above effect.

### **Gouriki Senpuu \- Strong Whirlwind**

Taking the Whirlwind back to the basics, the shinobi no longer bothers with a series of strikes, and instead just focuses their ability into a single roundhouse with more speed and power than the previous versions.

Stamina: 36
Damage: (STR /3)d12
Speed: 16
Area: STR/30
Special: Opener
Requires: Daisenpuu

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects: 
This damages everyone in range. If partial defense applies, this technique does 50\% of its normal damage per point it hits by, rather than 20\%. Anyone hit is knocked back STR/20 Yards.

Momentum: You designate only one target hit by this attack as your Combo Target. All Combo Jutsu gain Knockback of (STR/20) Yards. You can move an additional (STR/20) Yards for free as part of your “Move with an Attack” Maneuver with Combo Jutsu.


### **Dai Dageki \- Heavy Blow**

One of the simplest hand to hand maneuvers at the highest of levels, this attack is straight and to the point. Sacrificing trickery or fancy techniques, you deliver a powerful blow with the full weight of your body behind it.

Stamina: 32
Damage: As Basic Attack
Speed: 8
Special: Finisher

Tags: 1 Arm

Effects:
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack.

### **Gawa-Ryuu \- River Style**

The ultimate recourse of taijutsu fighters who are frustrated with only being able to land glancing blows on their opponents, this technique sends a surge of chakra through the attacking limb. This results in a burst of speed and strength, and also a chakra 'shockwave' along the edge of the attack that carries almost as much force as the strike itself.

Chakra: 15 \+ X/2

Effects:
This is activated after you hit with an Unarmed or Combo taijutsu attack at melee range, but its damage is reduced by partial defense. X is that technique's Stamina cost, after all modifications.

When you activate River Style, your Accuracy with that attack is retroactively increased by 3, or the minimum value to do full damage (i.e. overcome partial defense), whichever is lower.

Your opponent may spend Willpower on their defense after you've declared activation of River Style. If you then spend Willpower on your Accuracy, River Style's effects last until your attack has been fully resolved.

### **Kurokumaken - Black Bear Strength**

A devastating move, developed by a shinobi who claimed he had gained inspiration for it by watching the fighting tactics of wild bears. The user wraps their arms around their opponent and squeezes with incredible strength. Users of this move have been known to crack arm bones and break ribs.

It was later pointed out that real bears do not actually hug people, to death or otherwise. The original inventor of the move refused to comment, and the name was in wide use by that point anyway.

Stamina: 33
Damage: (STR /3)d12
Speed: 18
Accuracy: \-5

Tags: Attack, Melee, Blunt

If this Technique deals a wound, then it applies 2 to the Arms instead of just a single Wound. When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 5, and the and the damage increases to d20s.

### **Tora Rakka - Tiger Drop**

You flip your opponent over you and hurl them to the ground (or otherwise maneuver them unpleasantly if you're both already on the ground) and slam an elbow, knee, or other body part into them, using gravity to assist your momentum. Nobody really knows what this has to do with tigers.

Stamina: 30
Damage: (STR /5)d12
Speed: 9
Accuracy: \-5
Special: Stun 10

Effects:  
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack. If Tiger Drop inflicts a wound, it is dealt to the opponent's head. This technique leaves you and your opponent prone.

When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 5, the grapple is ended, and the damage increases to d20s. 

## **Unarmed A-Rank**

### **Okasho \- Cherry Blossom Impact**

Taking chakra infused muscles to the next level, the user focuses a massive amount of chakra into their fist, foot, or even fingertip. Upon striking the chakra is released into their target causing a great deal of damage. Given that the damage is dependent on the amount of chakra channeled, a truly great shinobi can even use this technique with a single fingertip.

Stamina: 35  
Chakra: X  
Damage: Xd12  
Speed: 24  
Requires: Chakra Strengthening, Chakra Control 30

Effects:
Okasho's Speed is multiplied by (your physical damage bonus) \+ (your ninjutsu damage bonus/2), rather than just your physical damage bonus. You may give this technique an Area of (X/4), though doing so reduces its damage to (X)d6.

### **Benkei-do \- Way of Benkei**

A mixture of folk hero and mythical character, Benkei was a warrior monk known for his peerless skill in combat and unswerving loyalty to his master. One of the popular stories about his exploits involved Benkei guarding a bridge, holding back hundreds of warriors before finally succumbing to his wounds. This technique pays homage to his exploits, focusing all a shinobi's efforts on defense.

Stamina: 10  
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: \+0

Effects:
You may activate Way of Benkei alongside a normal defense. Until your next action, your defenses have a (+1+X) bonus, with X being the number of times you've attempted to defend yourself (successfully or otherwise) since activating Way of Benkei (including the defense it was activated with). You may choose not to use Way of Benkei on a given defense; doing so does not reset its X value or require it to be reactivated.

The only defenses which "count" for Way of Benkei are dodges and unarmed parries. You may use other defenses, but they do not receive its bonus or increase its X value. Way of Benkei ends when your take a non-Interrupt action, at which point you pay a secondary Stamina cost of 10+3\*X, to a maximum of 40\. You may declare Block, Total Defense, Guard, and similar effects without ending Way of Benkei.

### **Gouken \- Iron**

A generalized term for one school of thought for how to approach taijutsu, the idea behind 'Iron Fist' is to give every attack one's all, aiming to cause the maximum amount of damage in as few strikes as possible. This often involves thrusting punches and short-range kicks, and is undeniably effective. The downside, however, is that putting all one's force into a single blow results in telegraphing one's motions to an observant opponent, and can quickly tire the user.

Stamina: \+X\*2
Accuracy: \-X/4 (round up)
Speed: Special

Tags: Interrupt

Effects:
This supplements another Unarmed Jutsu, or Basic Taijutsu Attack. That Attack's base Speed (including for damage calculations) is increased by X, and your Physical Damage Bonus is also increased by X.

X has a maximum of STR/10.


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Combo**

[|D-Ranks|](#combo-d-rank)
[|C-Ranks|](#combo-c-rank)
[|B-Ranks|](#combo-b-rank)
[|A-Ranks|](#combo-a-rank)

## **Combo D-Rank**

### **Rendan \- Combo**

Not so much a proper technique as a catch-all term for any series of attacks made in rapid succession, without breaking one’s flow or allowing an opponent time to retreat.

Stamina: 12  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 1d6  
Speed: 10  
Combo Counter: \+1d6 damage, \-1 Speed

### **Yaburi Yashi \- Smashing Palm** 

Usually considered a rude thing to do to someone, the user slams their open hand into their opponent's stomach at an upward angle, knocking the air from their lungs if done properly.

Stamina: 16  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 3d\*  
Speed: 15  
Special: Finisher, \-2 Accuracy  
Combo Bonus: \+1 to Target’s Stamina Penalty.

Effects: This is an automatic called shot to the abdomen. If it’s blocked, the accrued Stamina Penalty is halved

### **Gekido Denka \- Furious Charge**

The basis of combos in battle is maintaining one’s momentum, striking one blow before the opponent’s fully recovered from the one before it. In many cases, all one needs is a few seconds to get away from their opponent and catch their breath to escape an otherwise merciless beating. You, however, just love to beat people mercilessly. Though it’s taxing, you can keep your adrenaline up, and keep your blows coming rapidly and rhythmically, even after being forced to chase after your victims.

Stamina: 15  
Upkeep: 1  
Speed: 6

Effects: So long as you maintain Furious Charge, taking Move actions will not break your combos. Using movement based jutsu (such as Shunshin), however, will.

## **Combo C-Rank**

### **Shishi Rendan \- Lion Combo**

Ideally meant to be used after performing Kage Buyo, this is a series of high-speed punches and kicks.

Stamina: 18  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 2d8  
Speed: 10  
Combo Counter: \+1/2 Accuracy, \-1 Speed

### **Reikoku Kagai \- Relentless Assault**

You get in close to your opponent and begin beating on them\! Doing so for a prolonged period of time can easily overwhelm all but the strongest defenses.

Stamina: 16  
Damage: Base Unarmed Attack \+ 4d8  
Special: \-2 Accuracy  
Speed: 8  
Combo Counter: Blocking is 5% less effective, \+10 damage

### **Shoushitsu \- Rising Knee**

The user gets in close and slams their knee into the midsection of their opponent. While not complex, the pain experienced is enough to make them double over in pain, leaving them vulnerable for a few seconds.

Stamina: 15  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 4d\*  
Speed: 16  
Special: Finisher  
Combo Bonus: \+2 Stun, \+1d\*.

### **Shishi Danmaku \- Lion Barrage**

A popular way to end the similarly-named combo-assault, the Lion Barrage was is often taught to students along with Lion Combo itself. Advanced taijutsu users, however, have been known to appreciate the flexibility and fluidity that comes from separating the techniques. The Lion Barrage is simply a series of fast, strong fist and knee strikes.

Stamina: 25  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 6d\*  
Speed: 14  
Special: Finisher, \+4 Accuracy  
Combos Bonus: \+2d\*

### **Asshou \- Pressure Palm**

You deliver a powerful, downwards palm blow to an opponent's stomach or the small of their back, brutally knocking the wind from them and dazing them--repeated use of this can bruise a person's solar plexus, which pretty much hurts more than anything has any right to, for weeks.

Stamina: 24  
Damage: (STR/8)d8  
Speed: 21  
Special: Stun 12, Finisher  
Requires: Target to be Prone.  
Combos Bonus: Target makes a Stamina Check of (5 \* Combo Counter)

Effects:

This may only be used against an opponent who is prone (as from the E-rank Unarmed Jutsu “Trip”).

### **Hangeki Rendan \- Counter Combo**

Exploiting a momentary break in your opponent’s attacks, you turn the tables on them\! It’s very exciting, and stuff.

Stamina: 20  
Speed: 8  
Requires: A Target with an active Combo Counter.

Effects: You and your opponent both make Parry rolls. If your result is higher, you immediately break their Combo and can execute any Opener you know as an Interrupt, with a starting Combo Counter equal to whatever your opponent’s was when you used this technique. If you fail, your opponent may immediately use any Combo Jutsu they know against you as an Interrupt. Their Attack automatically hits.

### **Bunka-ken \- Splintering Fist**

A powerful blow that smashes through defenses. Your attack carries an almost concussive force behind it, enough to overcome all but the most resilient of enemies.

Stamina: \+7  
Speed: \+4  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack, Maximized  
Special: Finisher  
Combo Bonus: Ignore 10% of DR, enemy takes \+2 damage from all Attacks for the rest of the battle

Effects: This is applied as an addition to a Basic Unarmed Attack, increasing its Stamina and Speed accordingly and turning it into a Finisher. The ‘d’ in the damage calculation is replaced with ‘\*’, dealing the maximum possible damage rather than rolling. The lasting bonus damage from this technique is applied after all reductions (and after the Scorched Chest energy wound, if the opponent has it), but before determining if wounds are suffered from the attack. Multiple Splintering Fists on the same target stack the bonus damage normally.

## **Combo B-Rank**

### **Hasu Rendan \- Lotus Combo**

The user of this technique launches into a sequence of strikes designed to alternately wind, disorient, and daze their opponent, combining those effects to prevent their adversary from fighting back effectively for as long as possible.

Stamina: 10  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 2d10  
Speed: 4  
Special: Opener. This action’s Speed may not be reduced.  
Combo Counter: \+2d10 damage, \+2 Stamina, \+1 Accuracy

Effects: Each time this technique is used consecutively (with no other non-interrupt actions between uses), its base Speed increases by 2, its Stamina increases by 4, and it gives an additional 1 Combo Counter. This stacks; the fourth Lotus in a sequence would be Speed (4 \+ 2 \* 3\) 10, give (1 \+ 1 \* 3\) 4 Combo Counters, and have a Stamina cost of 22 (before Combo Counter effects). Additionally, Lotus Combo can extend existing stuns: If a target hit by Lotus Combo is Stunned, the duration of that Stun is increased by X \* 2, with X being the length of the current Lotus sequence. Thus, hitting someone with four Lotus Combos in a row would extend their stun by (2+4+6+8) 20\.

### **Hokuto no Ken \- Fist of the North Star**

Delivering a precise, rapid, and powerful series of blows to vital points on an opponent’s body, this causes their blood vessels to spontaneously rupture, resulting in both internal hemorrhaging and dramatic external bleeding, sometimes even resulting in a brief spray of blood immediately after its use.

Stamina: 28  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 9d\*  
Speed: 20  
Special: Finisher, \+2 Accuracy  
Combo Bonus: \+1d\* damage to Base Attack, \+2 Bleed

Effects: Even if Hokuto no Ken is parried, it still inflicts its Bleed.

### **Shougekishou \- Upwards Attacking Palm**

A difficult attack to connect with, the shinobi brings their palm from waist height and strikes upwards to full extension. This makes it exceptionally difficult to connect with, though if the user does hit they'll send their opponent flying away.

Stamina: 34  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 5d20  
Speed: 16  
Accuracy: \-6  
Special: Finisher  
Combo Bonus: \+2 Stun, \+1 Yard Knockback

Effects: If you are in a clinch, the Accuracy penalty is negated. The clinch is ended if this technique hits. After being hit the opponent is knocked back (STR/20) yards and left prone, as if they'd been hit with the E-rank Trip move.

If this Technique was performed as a Finisher and you would take your next non-interrupt action before your target performs any non-interrupt action of their own, you can immediately perform another Finisher of Rank C or below so long as you can cover the distance. This Finisher receives all the same benefits as Shougekishou did, including the same Combo Counter.

### **Aragami no Jutsu \- God of Battle Technique**

Rather than waiting for your opponents to give you openings and then capitalizing upon them, you make openings. When that doesn’t work, you break through your opponent’s defenses anyway, attacking even when it seems fruitless, until finally something gives.

Stamina: 20  
Upkeep: 0  
Speed: 6

Effects: Whenever you hit with a technique that raises your Combo Counter, your Combo Counter increases by 1 more, and Aragami’s Upkeep also increases by 2\. When your combo is broken, Aragami’s Upkeep is reset to 0\. If you end Aragami, your Combo Counter is immediately set to 0\.

### **Mouretsu Tora no Jutsu \- Furious Tiger Technique**

You break off your combo with an abrupt transition back into more traditional taijutsu techniques, taking advantage of the momentum and rhythm you’ve built up to deliver one devastating blow.

Stamina: \+10  
Speed: \+6  
Special: Finisher  
Combo Bonus: \+0.5 Accuracy, \+5% damage

Effects: This finisher is used by combining it with any Unarmed Taijutsu Technique, increasing its Stamina cost appropriately. The Combo Bonuses are applied to that Technique, modifying it appropriately

## **Combo A-Rank**

### **Nanto Rendan \- South Star Combo**

Stamina: 10  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 7d\*.Extra(“\*”-4)  
Speed: 10  
Combo Counter: \+2d\*.Extra(“\*”-4), \+1 Paralysis that lasts for 10 ICs

Combo: This attack gains \+1 Die per Cadence Rank and Paralysis 1\. The Paralysis lasts for 10 IC.

### **Akuma no Isoi \- Devil’s Rush**

A technique that requires extreme speed and toughness, and a considerable disregard for one’s own health. Most shinobi learn first-hand in the academy what ‘chakra burns’ are: burns, typically found on the hands (where chakra is typically focused), caused by poorly forcing too much of one’s chakra through their body’s “chakra pores”. This technique takes a common mistake among academy students and weaponizes it, forcibly overwhelming one’s own chakra circulatory system in the arms and hands, superheating their body. That, combined with the high-speed blows delivered by this technique, results in what appear to be literally flaming punches. This can actually be delivered in kicks as well, and the general consensus is that a ‘burning’ leg is more visually impressive. Most ninja, however, prefer punches, because they hate fun.

Stamina: 20  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 6d6.open(6)  
Speed: 10  
Combo Counter: \+1d6 damage, \+1 Ignite

Effects: If you hit, your target rolls Resistance against your Athletics. On a success, the severity of the Ignite is halved. You suffer Burns with a severity equal to the Ignite you inflict.

### **Taiyou Douyou no Jutsu \- Solar Agitation Technique**

For once, the name actually has a basis in reality\! This technique is a single, devastating blow to the opponent’s solar plexus, knocking the wind from their lungs and temporarily debilitating them in the aftermath.

Stamina: 30  
Damage: Basic Unarmed Attack \+ 10d20  
Speed: 18  
Special: Finisher, \+2 Accuracy  
Combo Bonus: \+3 Stun, \+1 to target’s Stamina penalty, \+1d20 damage

Effects: This has an additional feature if used against an opponent who was performing handseals. If the total Stun from Solar Agitation is greater than the Speed of their Perform Handseals action, the victim automatically Aborts their Perform Handseals action (as if they had failed the Chakra Control roll against the attack’s damage dealt), and must make a Chakra Exhaustion roll against the technique aborted.

### **Senkagami no Jutsu \- God of War Technique**

The greatest of hand-to-hand combatants are able to dispatch enemies one after another in the midst of battle, their momentum never lagging, their blows not showing the slightest hint of hesitation. If you’ve mastered this technique, you are officially one of them\! Congratulations\!

Stamina: \+5  
Upkeep: 0  
Speed: \+0

Effects: This is used alongside a Finisher. Using that Finisher does not end your combo; instead, your Combo Counter is halved, but you may continue your combo, make another finisher, or so forth. If your Finisher missed and you activated Senkagami, your Combo Counter does not decrease at all. After using a finisher with Senkagami applied, you gain an Upkeep of 5 from Senkagami; each subsequent use increases Senkagami’s Upkeep by 5 (10 after the second use, 15 after the third, and so forth). When your combo is broken, Senkagami’s Upkeep ends; similarly, if you end Senkagami’s Upkeep, your combo ends automatically.

## **Weapon D-rank**

### **Asahi \- Rising Sun**

A simple yet effective technique that utilizes the leverage of a weapon to deliver a deceptively fast upward strike.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \-3  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Neutral/Earth Stance  
Type: Melee

Effect:   
If no enemies act between this Attack and your next Non-Interrupt Weapon Attack, then that Attack may have its Base Speed halved for all purposes should you choose to. To a minimum of Base Speed 3\.

Stance Shift: Heaven Stance

### **Raaki \- Falling Moon**

A simple yet effective technique that utilizes the leverage of a weapon to deliver a deceptively fast upward strike.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 4  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Heaven/Wrath Stance  
Type: Melee

Effect:   
If your last Weapon Attack happened within the past 10 ICs, and no enemies have acted since, then this Weapon Jutsu will count as 1 Speed higher for Damage Purposes per every Speed reduction this Jutsu has from any source.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

### **Uneru Nami \- Rolling Waves**

The technique itself is simply a strong upward strike utilizing the weapon’s weight to add more leverage to the attack, either by starting from the ground, or bouncing the weapon off of a different surface (such as a wall, to every bricklayer's dismay) in order to bring it back up with speed. For some it’s a true stance they keep whilst utilizing their weapon, and others it’s just following the movements of their opponents as they swing upward toward them. Many a Kirigakure Genin have been found in the training grounds debating the complexity (or lack thereof) of this technique.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 6  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: 12 \+ (Weapon’s Speed/2)  
Delay: As Weapon \+ 4  
Requires: Earth/Void Stance  
Type: Medium/Large/Extreme Melee, Slashing/Blunt, Sword/Club/Polearm

Effect:   
Any positive or negative Accuracy your Weapon or Stance has for this Technique is negated (as though the Weapon or Stance had no bonus or penalty to Accuracy). For every \-1 Accuracy Penalty removed, this Jutsu gains a \+2 increase to its Damage Bonus. And for every \+1 Accuracy Bonus removed it, it gains a \-1 reduction to its Stamina cost and Delay.

Stance Shift: Wrath Stance

### **Kashiraheki \- Headsplitter**

Hoisting your weapon into the perfect position, taking your time to figure out the perfect swing, you bring it across directly into your target, or perhaps from above, with disastrous results\! Unfortunately, while this may be perfect for exploding someone's brains out, it's pretty obvious you are getting ready to do just that\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+8  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+6  
Delay: As Weapon \+2  
Requires: Heaven/Wrath Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Blunt, Sword/Club

Effects:  
This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Head. This technique will change your Stance to Broken instead of Neutral if you miss with it. 

The Damage Bonus of this Attack is increased by \+50%. 

Every 50 damage dealt by this technique gives the victim a \-1 penalty to Accuracy which lasts until their next attack or accuracy roll. If you deal more than 400 damage, for 50 IC whenever they perform any non-Area Attack, they must roll 1d2; on 1, their Attack functions normally. On 2, they have a \-5 Accuracy penalty due to disorientation and double vision

### **Nenten Tsuki \- Twisting Stab**

The user lunges forward while turning their wrist, drilling their weapon into the opponent, using chakra to enhance their momentum. It is very effective at breaking an opponent's guard as you spin the weapon to go around their defense.

Stamina: As Weapon \+2  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: 10 \+ (Weapon's Speed/5)  
Special: \-1 Accuracy  
Requires: Paper Stance  
Type: Melee, Piercing, Sword/Polearm

Effects:  
Any Defensive Interrupts performed against this Jutsu treat their Speed as if it was double what it actually is for the purpose of Defense Validity. If you miss completely, you enter the Broken Stance and the Speed of this Attack is increased by 3 for IC purposes, as you lunge and lose your balance

### **Ichi no Hoshi \- One Star**

By unfolding their fan only a third of the way, the user creates a small but biting gust of wind that is useful for its capacity to strike at targets far away while wielding a weapon.

Chakra: As Weapon  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon  
Delay: As Weapon  
Range: CHA/4  
Type: Melee, Fan

Effects:  
This attack uses your ninjutsu damage bonus, rather than your physical damage bonus. The Chakra cost of this technique is the same as, and replaces, the Fan’s normal Stamina cost. This attack can only be parried by things which state they can parry Ninjutsu.

### **Hamukau Kanjin \- Vital Strike**

Whether it be to cut someone's achilles tendon, or to gouge their eye out, weapons have many ways to disable or execute their wielder's opponents. Sneaking past your opponent's defenses and getting in even one good attack can change a fight, or end a life\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+4  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Neutral/Heaven/Earth/Void Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Piercing, Sword/Polearm/Chain/Fan

Effects:  
You may give yourself a penalty of up to \-(STR/10) Accuracy Penalty.

For every \-1 Accuracy Penalty, this Attack's Damage is increased by 10% for the purposes of inflicting wounds.

Even without any penalty, Partial Defenses are ineffective against this Attack, meaning that you still get full Damage.

Stance Shift: Paper Stance.

### **Fukumikuchi Hari \- Hidden Mouth Needles**

The user is able to summon needles from within their mouth and spit them at their opponents with force comparative to have been thrown. It's useful at point-blank range for catching the opponent by surprise, but becomes predictable with repeated use.

Stamina: As senbon multi-throw, \+3  
Chakra: 10, \+X  
Damage: As senbon multi-throw  
Speed: As senbon multi-throw, \-2  
Type: Senbon

Effects:  
This allows you to perform a multi-throw with senbon, following normal multi-throw rules, even without the ability which would normally allow you to do so. If you can multi-throw senbon without using this jutsu, it instead becomes an automatic Surprise Attack.  
X is the number of times you have previously used this technique in the same battle.  
Though this jutsu can be used as often as you wish, it may only be used as a Surprise Attack once every 100 IC; after that, it's just not surprising.

### **Kage Shuriken no Jutsu \- Shadow Shuriken Technique**

The user throws multiple Shuriken at the same time, positioning them in such a way that one or more weapons can hide within the shadow of another in flight, making the lower one(s) virtually invisible.

Stamina: 22  
Damage: As Weapon(s)  
Speed: 22  
Type: Large Ranged

Effects:  
You throw two of the same weapon, each doing their normal base damage, and using half this technique's Speed to determine how much they benefit from your damage bonus.

If this hits and partial defense does not apply, combine the damage of the two weapons. If it hits and partial defense does apply, one misses entirely and the other does full damage (not reduced by partial defense).

### **Mukadesuto \- Centipede Pincers**

Using two weapons in conjunction with one another, the user strikes repeatedly, flowing from one strike to the next in a barrage of attacks that can quickly overwhelm most opponents.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Void Stance, Dual Wield Attack  
Type: Small/Medium Melee, Dual

Effects:  
Each time this attack is consecutively used (even if it misses\!) the total Speed of the attack is reduced by 1, to a minimum of half its original value. Additionally, the number of dice on each weapon is increased by 1\.

These benefits reset if you make a non-Interrupt action other than a dual-wielded attack with your weapons or movement, or if you go for 15 IC or more without using this jutsu.

Stance Shift: Void Stance

### **Kusari no Hebi \- Chain Serpent**

With sufficient practice, the user can throw their chain weapon in such a way that it ricochets to strike their opponent multiple times, hitting and disarming them or tripping them at the same time, tugging on the chain to redirect it.

Stamina: As Weapon \+4  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+ 4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Type: Chain

Effects:  
If this hits, in addition to dealing damage you may attempt to either perform the E-rank taijutsu technique Trip or perform a Disarm against a weapon they're holding as a Speed 0 Interrupt. The Stamina costs and Speeds of these actions are included in this technique and they are considered to be the Speed of this attack for the purpose of what is considered a valid defence.

### **Omo Hoshiga \- Double Star Fang**

Several enemies running at an archer and getting in close could mean the end for an archer, but luckily you can fend them off\! Quickly drawing several arrows out, you load them all into your bow and fire them off in different directions. This would be hard for most people, but luckily you're a ninja.

Stamina: (As Weapon) \+ 5 \* X  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: As Weapon  
Speed: (As Weapon) \+ 3 \* X  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
You may target up to three additional people with this Attack; X is the number of people beyond the first who you Attack. This jutsu uses half your physical damage bonus

### **Soushuriken no Jutsu \- Manipulated Shuriken Technique**

You connect a thin, nearly invisible wire to shuriken or kunai when throwing them so that you can redirect them mid-air, or even attack people around corners or behind trees\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+3  
Damage: As Weapons  
Speed: As Weapon \+3  
Type: Small Thrown Weapons  
Requires: Ninja Wire

Effects:  
If you miss with this technique you can make an Accuracy roll with a \+4 bonus; if this hits, your attack hits but uses only half your damage bonus.  
You can also attack a person who you don't have line of sight on (say, they're around a corner) if you can somehow accurately perceive them; in this case the above paragraph does not apply and this technique has a \-2 Accuracy penalty.  
Used with a multi-throw attack, this increases the total Stamina and Speed of that action by the appropriate amount.  
The increase in damage bonus from multi-throwing (+0.5 per weapon thrown) is also halved by this technique if the Accuracy roll is used.  
The total of Ninja Wire required is the range at which you make this attack, multiplied by the number of weapons thrown. This does not need to be prepared in advance; you do it on the spot and use precisely the right amount of wire, via your ninja trickery.

### **Teki Tettai \- Tactical Retreat**

A Swift retreat is never permanent\! This attack demonstrates With swift precision, the user retreats gracefully, positioning themselves to evade counterattacks and assess their next move.

Stamina: As Weapon \+3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \-4  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Piercing, Sword/Chain/Polearm

Effects: After you hit with this Attack, you are able to move backwards (away from the Target and in the opposite direction you just attacked towards) to a maximum distance equal to the Final Speed of this Attack for free.

Stance Shift: Steel

## **Weapon C-rank**

### **Kousanami \- Cross Wave**

A versatile and elegant technique, although one with an infinite room for mastery. The weapon master brings their weapon up or down in a sequence of diagonal, or horizontal, or vertical slashes. Depending entirely on which stance they initially started in. This technique gets its name from the figure-eight motion the shinobi ends up drawing with their blade no matter which form their assault takes.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 8  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: 15 \+ (weapon's Speed)/2  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Heaven/Earth/Void Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing

Effects:  
This Jutsu gains an additional effect based on the Stance you were in when you initiated this Jutsu:

Heaven Stance: Your Attack's Damage is not mitigated by DR.  
Earth Stance: Your Attack cannot be Blocked and negates the benefits of the Target's Stand.  
Void Stance: Your Attack is treated as a Surprise Attack.

Cross Wave has only a single Accuracy, and is treated as one Attack. However, if the opponent uses a Defense where they roll for a result (such as Dodge or Parry), they must roll twice.

If the Attack hits the first Defense, that roll is used to determine how much Partial Defense, if any, is applied. If the second Defense also fails (Partial Defense being ignored for this purpose), your Attack's Dice Damage is quadrupled (From, for example, 5d8, to 5d8\*4)

If the attack misses against your opponent's first defensive roll, make the second roll. If it hits, this attack deals damage as a regular attack with your weapons (with the higher Speed associated with this technique). Meaning that you do not apply multiplied Dice Damage.

If you are using a two-handed weapon (such as a Nodachi or Zanbato), which would normally multiply your Damage Bonus by 50%, you do not receive that increase when using Cross Wave.

### **Hirameku Yaiba \- Flash Blade**

Using the principles of Iaijutsu, the user takes up a readied stance and, using a surge of chakra, rushes their opponent to take them by surprise, redrawing the weapon and striking in one quick movement.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+ 4  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Neutral/Earth Stance  
Type: Melee, Sword 

Effects:  
Make an Initiative Roll, opposed by your opponent's; they have a cumulative \+2 bonus for each time you've used this (successfully or not) in this battle. If you fail, you perform a Basic Weapon Attack attack.

If you succeed, your attack receives the benefits of the Iaijutsu Ability, even if you've used that earlier in battle.

Stance Shift: Heaven Stance

### **Kashiwa no Hishou \- Oak Flight**

Circling something large and blunt over your head, you slam it into your opponent after a few rotations and completely daze them. A powerful enough strike put in the right place makes it hard for the enemy to focus on you, or even gives them a bit of double-vision.

Stamina: As Weapon \+5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+5  
Type: Blunt

Effects:

### **Ni-Tōbun \- Bisection**

Requiring as much brute strength as perfect technique, this attack is a powerful downward strike that aims to split the target in half. Most of the force behind this fearsome slash is generated by capitalizing on the weapon's weight and the force of gravity, the weapon master's own muscles are mostly taxed in the effort of directing the heavy chunk of steel in the right direction to deliver a decisive and devastating blow which can cleave through guards, armor, and flesh and bone with equal ease. While simple in theory, the weapon master that is capable of performing such a brutal slash while maintaining perfect edge alignment is widely feared and respected.

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 10  
Damage: As Special  
Speed: 15 \+ (Weapon's Speed/3)  
Delay: As Weapon \+ 4  
Special: \- 2 Accuracy Penalty  
Requires: Wrath Stance, STR 100  
Type: Medium/Large/Extreme Melee, Slashing, Sword/Polearm

Effects:   
This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Torso. Multiply the Total Damage of this Attack by 2\.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

### **Surīburesu To-Resshō \- Three Breaths Dissolving Cut**

They say that a true master of the sword is able to cut down anybody, no matter who they were, within the span of three breaths. This technique is an expansion of that idea where the weapon master focuses on striking as many opponents as possible within an equally short time span by dashing through or past them faster than the eye can blink. Even though this technique has "Cut" in its name, it is also one favored by many spearmen who are able to run through many poor victims at once.

Stamina: X \+ (Weapon’s Stamina Cost)  
Damage: As Weapon   
Speed: X \+ (Weapon’s Speed/2)  
Delay: As Weapon   
Requires: Steel/Earth Stance  
Type: Melee, Slashing/Piercing, Sword/Polearm

Effects: This Jutsu can only be performed with a "Move with an Attack" Maneuver.  Calculate your "Move with an Attack" move distance as if you have moved for X amount of ICs, where X has a maximum of 5\. Your "Move with an Attack" maneuver must be a straight line, but it does not need to target any specific enemy, its target can be a location. Every enemy within that line must defend against this attack or they'll get hit by it. 

Stance Shift: Void Stance

### **Haganekabe \- Steel Wall**

By spinning their weapon rapidly with both hands, the weapon master deflects ranged attacks aimed at them as they close in on their opponents, and then use the momentum gained by the rotation to finish with a powerful swing.

Stamina: As Weapon \+5  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: As Weapon \-2  
Delay: As Weapon  
Type: Melee, Slashing, Polearm/Chain

Effects:  
When you use this technique, you begin spinning your weapon; so long as you keep doing this you may Parry incoming Ranged Taijutsu Attacks as a Speed 0 Interrupt with a \+5 bonus, but both your hands and your weapon are occupied (Meaning they cannot be used). Anyone attempting to attack you in Melee has their Action's Speed increased by 4, as they need to get around your weapon.

Furthermore, if this Jutsu was used with a Chain Weapon, then every (Weapon’s Delay \* 2\) ICs that somebody spends within the Range of your weapon while you maintain this Upkeep, you can perform a free Basic Weapon Attack against  

Stance Shift: Steel

### **Mawarisuto \- Rotation Strike**

Extending out a polearm, you hold one end with both hands then commence whirling and spinning the polearm around yourself in large circles\! If it has a blade of some sort, this is even better\!\!

Stamina: As Weapon \+8  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+10  
Requires: Polearm

Effects:  
You may attack anyone you choose within range 3\. If you choose to target only one person with this attack it has \+2 Accuracy.

### **Raikogeki \- Thundering Strike**

Drawing your weapon back and then lunging out quickly, you make a precise strike aiming to injure, hopefully cause them to bleed out a bit. Despite the slightly weakened nature of this strike, it's rather unnerving to be poked full of holes.

Stamina: As Weapon \+2  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \-4 (Minimum 3\)  
Delay: As Weapon  
Requires: Paper/Void Stance  
Type: Melee, Piercing, Sword/Polearm

Effects:  
This inflicts Bleed 2\. If used against a Target who is already suffering this Status Condition, this Jutsu instead increases the highest Bleed's severity by 1\.

Stance Shift: Paper

### **Goryū Rizumu no Jutsu \- Rumbling Dragon Beat Technique**

(Flavor Text)

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 7  
Damage: Special  
Speed: As Weapon \+ 10  
Delay: As Weapon   
Requires: Heaven/Wrath Stance  
Type: Large/Extreme Melee, Blunt, Club/Polearm

Effect: You strike the ground with your weapon and cause a miniature earthquake within an Area equal in size to your PDB (Rounded Down). Everybody that stands in that Area must roll to Dodge, after determining if they take any Area based Dodge penalties. This cannot be Parried or Blocked. If a Target fails their Defense, then they take half your Total Damage and fall Prone. 

Additionally, the ground in that area is permanently destroyed, becoming very unsteady terrain. Anybody that stands in that section of the battlefield (including you) will have their movement speed halved for all purposes as they can never find proper footing.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

### **Kuro Budounoki \- Black Vines**

A technique popularized by a Nara who liked to utilize a black-painted Kusari-Gama to strike from the shadows with a weapon when his opponents waited for them to move, you channel a small amount of chakra within your weapon and temporarily disconnect portions of it in order to extend its range beyond what an opponent would expect, grabbing hold and forcibly pulling them back to you for a follow-up strike.

Stamina: (Weapon) \+ 10  
Damage: Special  
Range: (Weapon) \+ NDB \* 2  
Speed: 10 \+ (weapon’s speed)/2  
Type: Chain

Effects:   
Make a Grab attempt with your weapon; if successful, you then begin a Grapple with your opponent and immediately pull them toward you until they are at Distance 0 with you. You can put them on any ‘side’ of you besides your back (Opposite of the side you attacked towards), if you wish, as part of this process.

Afterward you make a Basic Weapon Attack: If you’re holding two weapons, this can be with either one, using its normal Speed with a bonus of \+Xd\*, where X is the number of yards you pulled them toward you, to a maximum of double your weapon’s base dice. If you manage to wound your target with this, they take a \-2 to their Grapple rolls against you per severity of the Wound (-2 for Minor, \-4 for Major, etc), which lasts until the Grapple is broken.

If something prevents their movement toward you (such as being grappled by someone else who resists their movement, being tied up to a tree, or stuck in an Immobility 10 effect), then this technique has no effect other than establishing a grapple (which might end automatically, if they are beyond your normal grapple range).

AP spent to lower this Technique’s speed lowers both the speed you perform it at, Which is used for both the Grab and Attack to determine Valid Interrupts, and the speed for the damage of the Weapon Attack performed.

### **Ni no Hoshi \- Two Star**

Opening the fan two-thirds of the way for this attack, the user lets out a strong gust of wind, hopefully blowing their opponents away\!

Chakra: As Weapon \+5  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: CHA/4  
Speed: As Weapon \+5  
Delay: As Weapon  
Type: Fan

Effects:  
This uses your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus, plus one-fourth of your Physical Damage Bonus, and applies a Knockback of (PDB/2) Yards on hit. This attack can only be parried by things which state they can parry Ninjutsu.

### **Itowotoosu \- Thread the Needle**

Attaching Ninja Wire to the end of an arrow, the shinobi fires and uses chakra to alter the course of the arrow in mid-flight. This makes the shot extremely hard to avoid, at the cost of leaving a wire leading back to the point of origin.

Stamina: As Weapon+8  
Chakra: 18  
Damage: As Weapon  
Range: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon \+8  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
Every 10 yards you are from the opponent when firing adds \+1 to the Accuracy of this attack. Using this technique expends an amount of ninja wire equal to the distance between you and its target. After this attack is resolved, you are automatically removed from stealth (if you were hidden to begin with).

### **Chakura Nagashi \- Chakra Flow**

A technique which increases the potency of a weapon by running currents of chakra through it to enhance its existing properties or adapt it to a situation. The user must remain in physical contact with the weapon to sustain the flow of chakra, making this only effective with melee weapons.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Requires: Chakra Control 15, appropriate Elemental Aptitude  
Type: Melee

Effects:  
While you maintain this technique, your weapons gain the properties of your elemental affinity. When used against ninjutsu-based defenses, the weapon is considered to be of the relevant element to determine how effective the defense is against it. Additionally, it gains an additional effect based on the element chosen (listed below). This technique does receive your bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls from the Elemental Affinity ability.  
If you're using Dual Weapons, Chakra Flow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Chakra Flow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from your Chakra Flow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives Chakra Flow's effects as a Speed 0 action. Weapons created through jutsu can only be affected by chakra flow of their creation element.

* Earth: Your weapon gains Stun 2, or \+2 to its existing Stun. Every time somebody already stunned is struck by your weapon, their Stun is increased by 1\. Anyone who parries your weapon successfully suffers the Stun 2 (or \+1).  
* Fire: You add one third of your ninjutsu damage bonus to your regular damage bonus when using your weapon. To determine damage you multiply your attack's damage by its base speed, rather than modified speed.  
* Lightning: Any weapon that parries yours, or which yours parries, has a cumulative 10% chance of breaking and becoming unusable each time. Any damage reduction an opponent has is halved, and you ignore the effects of any armor they're wearing. Additionally, any time you inflict a wound with the weapon, your opponent suffers a Paralysis status of 1 per severity of the Wound (1 for Minor, 2 for Major, etc) for 10 IC (if the wound is somehow negated or ignored, they negate or ignore the Paralysis as well).  
* Water: Water's inherent fluidity and adaptability give you \+2 Accuracy, and an additional \+2 when parrying.  
* Wind: The efficacy of blocking is reduced by 30%, and your damage is considered 25% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds upon your enemies

This is complicated slightly when two weapons augmented by Chakra Flow interact, one parrying or being parried by the other. In these cases, if one of the elements is strong against the other, the weaker element's

Chakra Flow effects are ignored for the purpose of that parry. As a reminder: Fire beats Wind; Wind beats Lightning; Lightning beats Earth;

Earth beats Water; and Water beats Fire. This doesn't apply if the parry fails (if your Water weapon fails to parry their Fire sword, it still does that extra damage to you), but in the case of Earth vs. Water, does allow an Earth weapon to attempt to parry a Water one.

If you have an advanced elemental chakra nature (such as a Senju's Mokuton), you choose which of the two appropriate effects you're using when you activated Chakra Flow. For example, as a Senju you could receive either Earth's stunning or Water's accuracy and parry effects. You cannot change which you've chosen without ending and then re-activating Chakra Flow.

Despite this, it's still considered to be the advanced element when put up against ninjutsu defenses.

## **Weapon B-rank**

### **Hashadan \- Blade Breaker**

You deliver an overwhelmingly powerful blow, often an overhead strike, with all the force you can muster behind it; what it gains in force it loses in precision, but its real purpose is to destroy any weapons used by the victim for defense.

Stamina: \+10 or \+X  
Speed: \+0  
Type: Melee, not Small

Effects:  
This is used alongside any other attack with the weapon, including weapon taijutsu. If the attack is successfully parried or blocked by a weapon, the defender makes a Stamina roll. The normal \+5 bonus to Stamina rolls per level of Fatigue is replaced with a \-3 penalty (so someone at Fatigue 3 would have a \-9 penalty, instead of a \+15 bonus).  
The result of their roll becomes the X added to your attack's cost. Thus, if you used Blade Breaker with a Katana (Stamina 12), and your opponent parried your attack and rolled a 14 on their Stamina roll, the total Stamina cost would be (12+14) 26\. The weapon used to defend against your attack is destroyed.  
If your attack is not (successfully) blocked or parried, its Stamina cost is increased by 10 instead. If it is, but the enemy's weapon cannot be destroyed for any reason, the Stamina cost is increased only by 5\.  
This will destroy weapons created by Water-Cutting Blade and Earth-Smashing Staff, but not Burning Spear. The destruction of the enemy weapon takes place after their defense is resolved (breaking the sword which parried your attack does not prevent your attack from having been parried).

### **Hontō No Seigi \- True Justice**

Stamina: As Weapon \+ 4  
Damage: As Weapon   
Speed: 5 \+ Special  
Delay: As Weapon   
Requires: Heaven/Earth/Steel/Paper/Neutral/Void Stance  
Type: Melee

Effects:   
This Jutsu is used as a Weapon Parry with a \+2 Bonus. If you successfully defend, then you may immediately follow up with a specific Attack depending on the Stance you were in beforehand at no extra Stamina cost to you:

Heaven: Falling Moon  
Earth: Rising Sun  
Steel: Tactical Retreat  
Paper: Twisting Stab  
Neutral: Basic Weapon Attack  
Void: Any of the above

You use the results of your Parry roll as your Attack's Accuracy and increase that Jutsu's Speed for both damage and legal defenses by 5\. You may augment this Attack as you would normal attacks and this allows for attack-movement as part of it while it is an attack. This does mean that Sudden Attack and like bonuses would apply and can be declared as the attack is declared. Afterwards, you Shift your Stance according to whichever Jutsu you used.

### **Chakura Nagashi Shuusei \- Chakra Flow Modification**

Converting one's chakra to an element other than their affinity is difficult; doing so with chakra flow is even more so, as it requires converting your chakra to the desired element, then reabsorbing it in a continuous stream.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 12  
Speed: 10  
Requires: Chakra Control 25, Chakra Flow  
Type: Melee

Effects:  
As the C-rank Chakra Flow, but you may use elements other than your affinity. You may only maintain one element of Chakra Flow at a time, even if you're holding two weapons.  
You must be able to use ninjutsu of the appropriate  
element in order to infuse your weapons with that element of chakra.

### **Hien \- Flying Swallow**

This technique expands upon the concepts developed when learning the Chakra Flow technique. Instead of altering the nature of chakra flowing through their weapon, the shinobi changes the shape. This is used to expand the striking or cutting surfaces of the weapon with an invisible chakra blade, point, or blunt end.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 10  
Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow  
Type: Melee

Effects:  
The Reach of your Melee Weapon increases by 2, and its Dice amount is increased by 2\. This does mean that your weapon no longer triggers most On-Contact effects.

If you're using Dual Weapons, Flying Swallow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Flying Swallow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Flying Swallow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Tsubasa Migaku \- Blade Honing**

Despite being a fairly simple technique in concept, the precision necessary to perform it effectively, and without damaging one's blade, limits its use to more skilled shinobi.  
Focusing chakra along the edge of a bladed weapon, the user creates a 'second', sharper blade of chakra that essentially increases the weapon's sharpness, and also protects the blade itself from dulling.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: X/2 (round up)  
Speed: 10  
Type: Slashing

Effects:  
Your weapon deals X extra dice of damage, but its damage is reduced by (X\*5)% for the purpose of determining wounds. X has a maximum of (your Chakra Control skill ranks)/3.  
If you're using Dual Weapons, Blade Honing applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Blade Honing at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Blade Honing. If holding two nonDual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Ryuuketsu Ibara \- Bloody Thorns**

This technique coats the tip of a piercing weapon with a thin layer of chakra which reacts to puncturing a victim's flesh.  
When it does so, the chakra immediately forms a number of small thorns which tear the victim's flesh when the weapon is pulled out. The 'spikes' then return to being nothing but formless chakra, ready for the next attack.  
Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 10  
Type: Piercing

Effects:  
Your weapon inflicts Bleed 1 whenever it deals damage. If the victim has an existing Bleed status, it increases that status by 2\. This explicitly stacks with the C rank Thundering Strike (meaning it's Bleed 3, or \+3, if paired with Thundering Strike).  
If you're using Dual Weapons, Bloody Thorns applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Bloody Thorns at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Bloody Thorns. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Haruichiban \- First Storm of Spring**

The user of this technique throws multiple oversized  
shuriken in quick succession, pausing just long enough between each throw to correct for their opponent's movements.

Stamina: 14 \+ X \* 8  
Damage: ( (4 \+ STR/12) \* X)d12  
Accuracy: \-3  
Range: STR/3  
Speed: 12 \+ X \* 5  
Type: Large Thrown

Effects:  
You throw X Fuuma Shuriken or Large Star Shuriken, up to a maximum of STR/35 (May never exceed 4); all the weapons you throw must be of the same type. If this hits normally, its damage is increased by 5% per point it hits by (if Fuuma Shuriken were used), or 10% per point it hits by (if Large Star Shuriken were used); this is then reduced by partial defense normally.  
If Haruichiban misses, lower X by 1, its Speed by an additional 4, and raise its Accuracy by 3\. Repeat this until Haruichiban hits or X is 0\.  
This effect does not alter Haruichiban's Stamina cost, or what its Speed is for determining when your next action comes (in other words: it lowers the number of dice rolled, and the Speed for damage calculations, only).  
Partial defense is less effective than normal against Haruichiban; for each point it hits by, it deals 25% of its full damage.

### **Tentai-ite no Jutsu \- Celestial Archer Technique**

Every once in a while a shinobi gets it into their head that it would be a good idea to use a bow as their primary method of fighting. This rarely ends well, but the shinobi flair for the dramatic is often powerful enough to override both their good judgement, and any good advice they may receive. This technique was developed by those sorts of shinobi, in an attempt to make their weapon of choice less painfully impractical.  
The user concentrates chakra in their arms, speeding up their draw speed and allowing them to subconsciously correct their aim in an instant. The downside is that they sacrifice a great deal of power when doing this--but, as many users of it will assert, the technique is "way too awesome" for that to be a serious concern.

Stamina: 15  
Upkeep: 2 \+ X/3  
Speed: 6  
Requires: 2 ranks in Weapon Focus: Bow  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
While you maintain this technique's Upkeep, your bow's Accuracy penalty is reduced by X. If X is set higher than the value of your bow's Accuracy penalty (for example, you set X \= 10 and are using a Yumi), consider X to be just enough to eliminate the penalty for this technique's other effects.  
The base Speed of your bow is reduced by X/2, and the number of dice of damage it rolls is reduced by X. Your damage bonus when using your bow, after being multiplied as appropriate for the weapon you're using, is also reduced by X.  
Your damage bonus or number of dice cannot be reduced to 0 or lower; if they would, you are incapable of maintaining Celestial Archer at that level.

### **Gen'ei Tousekiki \- Phantom Ballista**

A distant derivative of the ubiquitous chakra flow technique, this concentrates chakra around the user's wrists and forearms. When an arrow is drawn back in a bow that chakra extends to wrap around it, and lingers long enough after being fired to strengthen the impact. More ambitious users can even form arrows out of pure chakra, though doing so rapidly puts a strain on their reserves.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 8 or 12  
Speed: 12  
Requires: Chakra Control 20, Chakra Flow  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
While this technique is maintained, your arrows deal an extra (CHA/12) dice of damage. For the purposes of ninjutsu-based defenses they are treated as being a ninjutsu attack of your elemental affinity (Upkeep 8\) or any element you have the ability to use (Upkeep 12), declared when you activate this technique. If you use your elemental affinity, the Chakra roll does receive the appropriate bonus.  
Additionally, you may create arrows out of pure chakra.  
Attacking with these arrows replaces your bow's normal Stamina cost with an equivalent Chakra cost \+5 (a Daikyu, Stamina 20, would become Chakra 25). These deal (CHA/8) dice of damage, and use (ninjutsu damage bonus \+ physical damage bonus)/2 in place of your normal physical damage bonus. These arrows use d12 for their damage if used with a Daikyu, or d6 with a Yumi.  
These arrows have a faint glow about them until they hit, a result of the chakra enhancing them. This tends to draw attention. When attacking from Stealth with Phantom Ballista (either a normal arrow, or one created from chakra) your Stealth TN is reduced by 7 (rather than 5).

## **Weapon A-rank**

### **Mikazuki no Mai \- Crescent Moon Dance**

Originally developed in Kiri, the technique has since been  
imitated and reconstructed in other villages. The user attacks at high speed, using a pair of clones to attack the target's blind spots; this actually consists of several strikes in quick succession, the user changing location after each and losing themselves among their clones. Understandably, this makes an effective defense against the technique difficult to come up with.  
Ideally, this technique is performed using Shadow Clones; other varieties of clones work, though are less effective, and in a pinch a ninja can briefly create the necessary clones as part of the technique, though doing so is draining on their chakra, and the clones disappear immediately afterwards.

Stamina: 30 \+ (Weapon)  
Damage: Four times the normal amount of dice rolled by your weapon.  
Chakra: 30 \- 15 \* X  
Speed: 20  
Delay: 15 \- 5 \* X  
Type: Sword

Effects:  
X is the number of Shadow Clones you have armed with weapons which can be used with this technique, up to a maximum of 2\. Crescent Moon Dance is always considered a surprise attack, and defending against it must be done as if it was half its actual Speed (if you used 5 AP to reduce it to Speed 15, it would count as Speed 8; this would require a Speed 4 or lower Interrupt to defend against Crescent Moon Dance).  
Clones used with this technique must have the same weapon you do and be capable of attacking and dealing damage. If you have two or more such clones that aren't shadow clones (such a Rock or Water Clones), X is considered to be 1; X cannot go above without using actual Shadow Clones.  
Attempting to parry Crescent Moon Dance requires the defender to roll 2d20.takeLowest(1) in place of 1d20. Ninjutsu-based defenses do not suffer from this limitation.  
Crescent Moon Dance cannot benefit from Iaijutsu (or, as a result, Flash Blade), and the wounds it deals are reduced by one category.  
Crescent Moon Dance may not have its Speed reduced below its Delay.

### **Kadou Kikan \- Vortex Engine**

Spinning their fan like a staff user would, this doesn't create an impenetrable defense, instead the fan is twisted to use all that force to create massive wind gusts.

Stamina: 45  
Upkeep: 12  
Damage: (Weapon's damage) \*4  
Speed: 16  
Range: CHA/6  
Requires: Fan

Effects:  
When this technique is activated, everyone in front of you, in a tunnel-shaped space ten yards wide, can choose to either take damage from this technique. or be knocked back CHA/6 yards. This requires no Accuracy; it cannot be dodged, or parried by ninjutsu. Defenses which work without a roll (such as Earth Shore Return) do function against it.  
This effect occurs again every 5 IC so long as you maintain the Upkeep. Each time after the first, the divisor on your CHA for the range (but not the distance knocked back) is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of CHA/1, 25 IC after you begin Vortex Engine), and the Speed is considered 1 higher for the purposes of determining damage.  
While this technique's Upkeep is maintained you may take no other actions, including Interrupts. The Stamina cost is paid only way in it's initially activated. If you use AP to reduce the Speed of the initial activation, the Speed of the damage dealt every 5 IC afterwards is similarly reduced.

### **Sanjuu Hayate \- Three-fold Gale**

With this technique, three shots are fired in rapid succession. With each arrow fired, the archer takes note of the effects of drag and wind speed, as well as their opponent's reaction, and compensates before launching the next arrow. In addition to requiring an incredible degree of focus, this technique is quite taxing to perform.

Stamina: As Weapon \*3  
Damage: As Weapon  
Speed: As Weapon+15  
Type: Bow

Effects:  
This attack consists of three separate shots. When you attack make three Accuracy rolls, the first as normal, the second with a \+2 bonus, and the third with a \+4 bonus. The opponent makes a single defense against this attack, unless they're parrying (not including ninjutsu-based defenses), in which case they must defend against each one with a separate parry roll and action.  
Each arrow multiplies your damage bonus by half of  
Sanjuu Hayate's Speed, but rolls its full amount of dice. The damage of these shots is combined when damage reduction is applied and to determine wounds inflicted.  
If you have aimed your bow ahead of time (taking an Aim action, as described in the bows themselves), that Accuracy bonus applies only to the first of Threefold Gale's rolls.

# **Grapple**

## **Grappling Basics (read this section)**

Grappling comes with a lot of rules detailed below but it can be simplified depending on your usage, separating grapple users and poor ninja with the misfortune of fighting one. Below will be rough summaries for each.

If you just want to know how to escape from the 7ft giant choking you out then all you need to understand is escape methods and the difference between clinch and pin. Your primary methods of getting out are Break Clinch and Escape Pin. By using them multiple times you keep increasing your bonus until you are finally able to break out. If you are pinned you want to use Escape Pin and if you are in a clinch you want to use Break Clinch. Escape Grapple provides an alternative method for getting out but has higher risk for a higher reward.

As a grappler your goal is to gain as much control as you can while dropping your opponents. Step 1) Setup a clinch, Step 2) Use a takedown to pin them, Step 3) Make them suffer. Other grapple jutsu are designed to reduce your opponent's control to make it harder to escape. Once you have them in a pin you can either pummel them with taijutsu attacks or lock them in a hold.  

Certain situations within a grapple may call for a 'grapple roll'. When this happens, the player that triggered the Check rolls Grapple Offense and the other rolls Defense.

[M10] Grapple Off: 10 \+ Control \+ STR/10 \+ Any relevant bonuses/penalties
[M11] Grapple Def: 1d20 \+ Control \+ STR/10 \+ AGI/20 \+ Any relevant bonuses/penalties

While in a grapple all participants gain access to the following actions:

Reposition (Stamina 5 \+ X\*2, Speed 2 \+ X) You may spend X AP to increase your control by that amount. X has a maximum of your ranks in either the pressure or Escape Artist abilities.

Break Clinch (Stamina 5 \+ X/2, Speed 5 \+ X/2, Delay X, Control 0) Must be used in a clinch. You make a Grapple Defense roll versus your opponent’s Offense. If you succeed, the grapple ends immediately. You gain a \+X bonus to the roll. The maximum of X starts at 1 and increases by 1 for every 5 IC the current grapple has lasted.

Escape Pin (Stamina 7 \+ X/2, Speed 6, Delay 10, Control 0) You make a Grapple Defense roll versus your opponent’s Offense. If you succeed, the grapple ends immediately. You gain a \+X bonus to the roll. The maximum of X starts at 1 and increases by 1 for every 5 IC the current grapple has lasted.

## **Grapple-Related Tags (also this)**

Trapping X: Requires you to be in a clinch, make a grapple roll and on a success reduce the target’s control by X on top of any additional effects provided by the technique.

Takedown: Requires you to be in a clinch, make a grapple roll and on a success you and your target are transferred to a pin on top of any additional effects provided by the technique.

Ground Fighting X: Requires you to be in a pin, make a grapple roll and on a success reduce the target’s control by X on top of any additional effects provided by the technique.

Submission: Requires you to be in a pin, make a grapple roll and on a success your target receives all effects of the jutsu. When your submission is ended your IC is increased by 5.

Pummel: While in a grapple this modifies an attack turning it into a grapple jutsu. You may choose to attack as normal or use your grapple offense vs your opponents grapple defense. If the attack has an accuracy penalty your grapple offense gains that penalty. The defender may block if they have the ability to do so. 

You may only use one trapping or ground fighting jutsu (successfully) per grapple resetting when it changes category (clinch to pin or vice versa). Regardless of type, all grapple jutsu require all 4 limbs to be free except for Escape Grapple.

## **Control**

Grappling is all about moving positions to force your opponent into a disadvantageous position. A grappler will use this to progress to stronger holds while their opponent may do everything they can to worm their way out. To determine starting control, make opposing grapple checks with the instigator rolling offense and the defender having the choice to roll offense or defense. The winner gains control equal to the amount they beat their opponents roll.

If the person with control gains more their amount is added to their total. If the person without control gains some, their opponent's control is reduced to that amount (potentially reducing it back to 0 where any more control would become their positive amount). Each participant has a max Control of 10 \+ half their ranks in Pressure (rounded up).

While in a clinch or grapple you are not restricted by what actions you can take. However, there are many ways for your control to be reduced whether by your actions or your opponents. Below is the list of the most common ways for control to be lost which occurs after the action takes place:

> Any action with a listed control reduces it by that much such as most grapple jutsu and grapple-related actions do. This occurs before the jutsu’s effects.

> Every other action (including interrupts reduces your control in the grapple by one-third its speed (rounded down)

> Receiving damage greater than your RES / 4 reduces your control by 1 

> Receiving damage greater than your RES / 4 reduces your control by 1

> Each unique Status Condition reduces your grapple offense and defense by their severity/4 (minimum of 1)

## **Clinch**

You are clinching and clinched by your opponent. In a clinch, the following effects apply to all participants:

> Any movement (such as running, Shushin, knockback) is halved, and moves the other person along with them.

> Any interrupt has its Speed increased by 2.

> If either person is suffering from the Ignite status, both people are treated as having the highest severity present.

> Neither person is capable of entering Stealth through any means and if they were hidden beforehand, then they’re automatically revealed to everybody in the battlefield.

## **Pin**

When you pin an opponent, as the aggressor, you bring your opponent down to the ground usually to prepare some kind of hold. While pinning an opponent, the following effects apply:

> Both participants gain all effects of a clinch listed above and the prone condition.

> The person being pinned has their speed reduced to 0

> You may end the pin at any time reverting back to a clinch with a Speed 5, Control 5 action.

You gain access to the following action:
Set-up (Stamina 10, Speed  5, Control 5) Make an opposed grapple roll. If you succeed, your next attack against them within 10 IC gains \+3 to its accuracy and \+0.5 to its Damage Bonus for each point their Grapple Roll fails to meet yours.

## **Grapple E-rank**

### **Grab**

You grab onto an opponent, with the intent to not let go\! It's not a preferred method of fighting among ninja, but it does have some limited popularity amongst certain taijutsu fighters.

Stamina: \+ X/2
Speed: \+ X/3, Delay \+X/3

Effects:
This is added on to a Break Clinch or Escape Pin. X has a max of the X on your Break Clinch or Escape Pin action all calculations with it are rounded up.

### **Hijutsu: Full Nelson - Secret Technique: Full Nelson**

With both arms you encircle the opponent's arm under the armpit, and secure at the opponent's neck. This restricts their movement making it very difficult to escape or even fight back.

Stamina: 28
Speed: Variable
Special: Control 8

Tags: Trapping 10, Submission 12, 2 Arms

Effects:
Your opponent gains immobility 6 and you gain half as much. Every 10 IC you maintain this technique your opponent reduces their control by 5. This may allow you to increase your control to double its normal maximum until this jutsu ends.

### **Mae Hadaka Jime: Guillotine Choke**

A powerful chokehold from the front encircling your opponents neck like a guillotine (huh like the name). This cuts off their airflow and can be used from a standing position.

Stamina: 28
Speed: Variable
Special: Control 10

Tags: Submission

Effects:
You may use this in a clinch but its control cost is increased by 5. Your opponent is pinned and on use and every 10 IC you maintain this Submission have your opponent roll grapple defense vs your offense. Regardless if they pass they gain 1 suffocation, +1 for every 10 they failed by.

### **Turtle**

Curling up into a ball as an opponent chokes you out is a natural reaction, but as a master grappler you know how to turn this position into a strength and break out of whatever hold your opponent has you in.

Stamina: \+X if successful
Speed: \+X, Delay 4\+X

Effects:
This is added on to an Escape Pin action and causes you to automatically succeed. The X in this jutsu’s cost is the amount you failed by. On a failure nothing happens, on a success you escape the pine but have you and your opponents control set to 0.
