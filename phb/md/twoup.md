# **2 Point Uniques**

### **Boundless Chakra**

You have near-limitless reserves of chakra. Things that should tire people out simply don't have that effect on you. 

You have a \+3 bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and whenever you acquire a Chakra Exhaustion penalty from using a jutsu, that penalty is reduced by 1\.

The Upkeeps of all your jutsu are reduced by 1\.

Whenever you rest, you may increase its speed by two to have your Chakra Exhaustion penalty lowered by the same amount as your Stamina penalty. 

Upgrades From: Expansive Chakra

Upgrades Into: Regenerative Chakra

### **Bruiser**

You hit harder than you have any business doing. You may not be bulky and muscular, but you know how to use your weight and momentum.

You add RES/40 to your physical damage bonus (to one decimal point, as usual).

Every time you perform a grapple jutsu on an opponent, you increase their stamina penalty by 1, this cannot be avoided by effects like Endless Energy.

You reduce any damage you take by STR/10. 

You also receive the benefits of either the Martial Prowess or Wrestling Prowess Unique. 

Incomptabile With: Martial Prowess, Wrestling Prowess  
Upgrades From: Martial Prowess, Wrestling Prowess  

### **Chakra Sensor**

You possess the coveted ability to sense the chakra in living things. Among other tricks you can do with this ability, you can tell people apart by their chakra alone.

Your maximum Chakra Control Ranks are increased by 3 and you have a \+3 bonus to your defensive Genjutsu rolls.

Your sense range is CHA\*5. Whenever someone within your sense range advances a Fatigue level due to failing a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you know their location and can identify their chakra signature, as well as their current Fatigue level. In combat, this effect takes place whenever they make a Chakra Exhaustion roll.

You can also tell any general traits of their chakra ("oppressive", "weak", etc.), if they've fallen into HP, and what their Elemental Affinity is (only if they have ranks in the ability). If you detect somebody who's in Stealth, you know their location (i.e. they are no longer hidden from you, just as if you'd found them normally). You can also use the following action:

Scan (Speed 6\)

In combat, make an opposed Chakra Control roll against anyone (or everyone) present; people may allow themselves to fail this roll rather than bothering with it. People being scanned have a penalty to their Chakra Control roll equal to the total Upkeep penalty of any jutsu they're maintaining. If you succeed, you detect them as described above. Out of combat, if someone passes a roll against your Scan they will automatically pass all other rolls against it made within the next half hour.

You also receive the benefits of the Alert unique but you can choose to use Scan in place of Search when using its reaction against Surprise and Sneak Attacks.  
You cannot have this unique as well as Alert.

Upgrades From: Alert

### **Cunning**

You're a master manipulator, a shinobi that fully understands the human mind and how best to twist and control it. There's likely something unsettling about you.

The cost of your Skill Focus ability for Diplomacy increases by 1 every 3 ranks, rather than 1 every 2 ranks.

You have a \+2 bonus to all Genjutsu rolls and TNs, and reduce the base Speed of all Genjutsu by 3. When Genjutsu Kai is used to break one of your genjutsu’s you may reduce its duration by 10 to force the target to roll their genjutsu defense again.

You also gain the benefits of Applied Knowledge

Incompatible with: Applied Knowledge  
Upgrades from: Applied Knowledge

### **Determined**

You are actually good at something--you just haven't figured out what yet. Some day you'll figure out where your natural talent lies, or everything will just suddenly 'click' for you, and you'll go from underdog to legendary ninja in the making, proving to everyone how great you are. That's what you keep telling yourself, anyway. It gets a little bit harder to believe that every day, but you didn't get where you are by giving up just because you're no good at whatever it is you keep failing to do. 

You can re-roll any Willpower or Willpower-like ability (such as Limit Break) once each time you make such a roll.

Whenever you advance a level of Fatigue you gain 1 temporary Willpower point. This point is lost if you do not use it before you advance a Fatigue level again (you can only have 1 temporary WP from this unique at a time).

Additionally, you gain all the benefits of Hidden Potential.

Upgrades From: Hidden Potential

Upgrades Into: Any 3-point unique.

### **Elemental Mastery**

You have peerless control over elemental chakra, far beyond the realm of what's considered normal, and to a level that some would even think is impossible. Choose two elements; you can use them as if you had taken the Elemental Aptitude ability for them. Additionally, your ranks in the Elemental Affinity ability apply to all elements you can use. And your NDB increases by 0.25 for every rank in Elemental Affinity you have. This doesn't mean your personal chakra nature corresponds to all five elements, only that you're equally skilled with them all.

Additionally, you have an Elemental Shaping pool which dictates how much you can modify any given basic Elemental Ninjutsu (advanced elements can not be shaped). You gain four points for each rank of any elemental jutsu you know (for a potential maximum of 24). You can use your Elemental Shaping pool to modify any Elemental Ninjutsu you perform in the following ways (which doesn’t ‘use up’ your pool; its size simply determines how much you can modify any given technique):

\> 15 points: +1 Target

\> 8 points: +1 Accuracy

\> 6 points: Add an Elemental Effect: Immobility +1 (Doton), Burns +1 (Katon), Paralysis +1 for 10 IC (Raiton), Stun +2 (Suiton), Knockback +4 yard (Fuuton)

\> 5 points: +1 Area/Radius

\> 3 points: +0.5 Damage Bonus

\> 2 points: +1 Damage Dice 

\> 1 points: +1 Range

For every 3 points (rounded down) the cost of the jutsu increases by 1 Chakra.  

There are some exceptions to the above: The Damage Dice from this Unique are rolled separately from the normal damage rolls and added at the end to the final total, meaning if the damage has special functions such as Katon’s exploding dice or Raiton’s multipliers then these extra die don’t benefit from them. For jutsu which launch projectiles at targets (but are not AoE, such as Houenka), additional targets gives a single extra projectile. Area and Range increases cannot add more than half the technique’s original Area or Range, and Range cannot modify a technique whose range is Touch. Similarly, any technique which does not list Area or Range cannot have them added to it to gain those qualities. The effects added from Shaping (aside from Suiton’s, which is automatic) do not require a status roll, but do require you to hit, and accordingly do not apply to environmental effects (such as Hidden Mist, or Yomi Numa), though they can be added to techniques which already have them, so long as they’re a valid choice.

Shaping does not ‘combine elements’ in any sort of way (overt or otherwise), but rather modifies one element based off of properties of another: A Suiton that burns might be described as pressurized to tear away at the skin on contact, while a Raiton that knocks back a target might actually seem to crackle through the air and strike from below to lift someone off their feet as it hits. Just take care not to describe a knockback Suiton as Hyouton, for example, or a Fuuton that burns as Scorch release: advanced elements are a true combination of two different chakra nature types, while Shaping is modifying the base element in the style of another.


Upgrades From: Elementally Gifted


### **Endless Energy**

You don't get tired. It's just not something you do. 

Whenever your Stamina penalty increases, it increases by 1 less. 

The first time in a battle you fail a Stamina roll, you advance one less Fatigue category. 

You enjoy a \+(RES)/40 bonus to all your Stamina rolls and every 15 IC, your Stamina penalty decreases by 1\.

Upgrades From: Indefatigable

Upgrades Into: Surging Power

### **Exceptionally Fast**

You take speed to a new level. You outrun the wind, your allies, and yes, even the angry wasps chasing you. Everything you do is almost too fast for the eye to follow. 

The Base Speed of all your Actions is reduced by 10%; this reduction is actually rounded up, meaning that a Speed 11 technique would be reduced by (11\*0.1 \= 1.1 \-\> 2\) 2, to Speed 9\. Even so, it cannot be used to reduce an action to Speed 0\. 

As long as you partially succeed in a Dodge, you take no secondary effects from the Attack (such as status conditions, penalties, or wounds) 

You also gain the benefits of the Blur Unique.

Incompatible With: Blur  
Upgrades From: Blur

###  **Fixer**

You know people, and people know you. From court officials across many realms and borders sending you secrets better kept behind closed doors, to merchant caravans and sailors that bring you tidings from across all four corners of the world, and even the lowly peasants and urchins who are the real seat of power of any nation. You know things sooner than anybody else, you know things that nobody else does. And you know how to manipulate that information to always stay on top and develop connections which give you many advantages in life. You could earn good money selling the secrets that are sealed in that mind of yours, but don't do it too much\! Or else they will no longer be secrets\!

You have a \+3 bonus to your Diplomacy Checks and any roll made through the Crafting Downtime Action.
You have a 30\% discount on any Equipment purchases and all crafting costs.

Additionally, you gain the benefits of Scheduled.

Incompatible With: Scheduled
Upgrades From: Scheduled

### **Fan of Knives**

Fan of Knives

You have a strong preference for thrown weapons of all kinds, and have the skill to prove it\!

You reduce all Seal Speeds and Ranged Attack speeds by 4, and may throw up to DEX/7 weapons with a multi-throw. 

Additionally, if you throw 15 or more projectiles, then the multi-throw gains an Area equal to (Projectiles thrown/3).But the Wounding applied by the Attack is further reduced by one Severity, to a Minimum of none. 

You can Parry Ranged Weapon Attacks directed at you with your bare hands. If you successfully Parry a Ranged Weapon Attack, you add the weapons used in the attack to your inventory for the remainder of the battle. Weapons gained this way retain any special properties they originally had (such as poisons, or primed Exploding Tags, which will still go off). If you successfully Parry one part of a multi-part Attack, you cancel any remaining portions of the attack (i.e. If you Parry Manipulated Shuriken Technique, the attack cannot be rerolled with the accuracy bonus, it stops entirely).

You have access to the following action:

Cut Off (Speed 4, Interrupt)

You may perform a ranged Parry against any non-AoE ranged attack (Including Ninjutsu), with a \+4 bonus by throwing a number of projectiles to block the path of the enemy's own projectile(s). The attack parried does not have to include you as a target; you may Parry attacks directed at others within the range of your Thrown Weapons. For the case of parrying Thrown Weapons, you must match the exact number that the enemy is throwing to successfully cut off his assault. And for Ninjutsus, you must sacrifice a specific number of Thrown Weapons based on the Rank of the Jutsu the enemy is using \[5 for E Ranks, 10 for D Ranks, 15 for C Ranks, 20 for B Ranks, 25 for A Ranks\].

Incompatible With: Nimble Hands  
Upgrades From: Nimble Hands 

### **Imposing Presence**

You gain a new "Goad" Action in Combat:

Goad \[Speed 8\]:

Effects: Choose any number of targets and roll a Contested Diplomacy Check against their Resistance or Espionage. You get a \-2 for every target past the first and they get a \+2 for every time you’ve used this action against them. For every 2 points you get above their roll, they'll receive a \-1 Penalty to Accuracy when Targeting anybody but you, up to a Maximum of \-3. This penalty lasts for a duration of ICs equal to five times the difference between your rolls to a maximum of 30\.

This action may be used simultaneously with another defensive option as part of the Total Defense ability. If used in this way you are considered to be using the secondary action until your next action.

Your maximum ranks in Diplomacy increases by 2\.

Additionally, you gain all the benefits of Silver Tongued.

Incompatible With: Silver Tongued

### **Jutsu Master**

You have a knack for mastering new jutsu, and, more impressively, not confusing them with one another no matter how many you seem to learn. 

The cost to learn non-clan jutsu is reduced by a third, before any other reductions. If you also have Genius, then the combined effect is that your jutsu are reduced by two thirds. Round up the final cost of any jutsu. This is, in fact, retroactive\!

Additionally, when you perform a Ninjutsu, you reduce its Speed by 1 for every 3 Seal Speed Reduction you have beyond the Seal Speed of the Jutsu as if you spent AP.

Additionally, you gain all the benefits of Seal Master.

Incompatible With: Seal Master

Upgrades From: Seal Master

### **Leader**

There is that unique, unexplainable spark of charisma to you, people enjoy your presence and when you speak they give very careful consideration to what it is you have to say. Qualities like these can build a nation, or bring an opposing one to its knees.

Whenever an ally gains AP, you gain half that much AP also.

You can spend AP in place of an ally to modify their action as if they had spent the AP themselves, this can be combined with them spending their own AP, but all restrictions for AP apply as normal with one exception, if your ally is the target of a Surprise or Sneak Attack, you can still spend AP for them.

If you know the Principle of Motion ability, you can apply its effects to an Ally instead of yourself when using it. You cannot do any of this while suffering from a Stun effect, however. You can only use your regular AP Pool for this purpose, AP from other Pools (like Gates or Weight Trainer) cannot be used.

You may spend 15 AP to replace an ally’s attack's Accuracy (or convert its existing accuracy roll) into an accuracy roll using 2d20 and keeping the higher one in place of 1d20.

You also gain the benefits of the Close Ties unique with the following exception: You can designate anyone in the current battle as your Ally even if you have never met them before.

Upgrades From: Close Ties

### **Protector**

Your allies are your life and you will make sure no harm comes to them. Becoming either a wall in between them and your enemies, or an unstoppable force that ravages the oncomers, you will always do your best to get everyone else out safely. 

You add your RES one more time to your Vitality and HP.

Your Take the Hit action automatically succeeds. You are always considered Blocking when performing the Take the Hit action and you can use any valid non-dodge Interrupt to defend from the attack. You cannot however use the Take the Hit action if you are stunned or suffering from an Immobility effect of 10 or higher.

You also gain the benefits of the Close Ties unique with the following exception: You can designate anyone in the current battle as your Ally even if you have never met them before.

Upgrades From: Close Ties

### **Single-Handed Seals**

Be it rigorous training or just excess talent, you've mastered one of the most exceptionally rare talents among shinobi: being able to perform handseals with only a single hand. 

You only need one hand free to perform Handseals.

You reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/7 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has a 10% bonus to its damage. 

Your maximum and current Chakra Control ranks are increased by 2, and you reduce the Seal Speed of any ninjutsu by an additional Chakra Control/10 while using both hands.

Incompatible with: Seal Master  
Upgrades From: Seal Master, Nimble Hands

### **Skirmisher**

You prefer a very specific style of fighting: engage your opponent, seize the advantage while they're confused, then fall back and disengage. While they're trying to recover, prepare yourself to repeat that again, and do so until your enemies are too demoralized or badly beaten to fight back. 

When making Attacks while in Stealth 2 your damage bonus is increased by DEX/30 for Surprise Attacks, and by DEX/20 for Sneak Attacks. 

Your limit for Stealth skill ranks is increased by 3, and you can hide so long as your opponents have a visibility penalty of \-4 or worse. Moreover, the first time somebody's Visibility Penalty reaches \-4 or higher, in Combat you are automatically hidden from them at Stealth level 1 with a Stealth TN of as if you have rolled a 10 on your Stealth Check. This effect does not trigger again if they were to reach Vis \-4 or higher a second time in that specific Combat encounter.

Your penalties for multiple uses of Stealth in the same battle is reduced by 5\.

You also gain the benefits of Lightfoot.
