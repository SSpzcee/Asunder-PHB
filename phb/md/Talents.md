# **Earning Talents**

## **Introduction**

Talents are things which differentiate your character from the rank-and-file ninja. Jutsu, skills, and abilities are all things which are fairly common. True, most ninja won't know A ranked Suiton jutsu--but knowing them is less a sign that one is "special", and more an indication that you're an advanced ninja.

Talents are somewhere between uniques and abilities. They're not fundamental aspects of your character--they're things you've learned or developed over time, that are genuinely hard to come by in an average shinobi.

In a more meta sense, talents are a way of getting rare, exclusive abilities for your character. And the best part, they're totally free\!

## **Acquiring Talents**

You get talent points automatically as your character gains experience. You get talents at the following XP milestones:

1000  
2500  
4500  
6000  
And every 1500 XP afterwards (7500, 9000, etc.)

Thus, a 3000 XP character would have two talents\!

You don't have to choose talents as soon as they're accessible. If you get to 1000 XP and aren't sure what you want, it's perfectly alright to hold off until later. There are no penalties for waiting until later to pick talents.

You can take "Enhancement" talents repeatedly, whereas most "Capability" talents can only be taken once.

### **Types of Talents**

Talents are divided into two broad categories: Enhancements  
and Capabilities.

Enhancements are ways in which your character is just plain better than the rank-and-file ninja. They're things you're able to do that can't be taught or learned, fundamental parts of you. These are all passive benefits. You can always take Enhancement talents at any point in time so long as you have the talent points for them.

Capabilities are a bit different. They're things you've learned how to do, rare or esoteric techniques that anyone could, in theory, learn, if they had the opportunity and dedication.

All of the talents listed in "Capabilities" can be only acquired through other means--for example, some skilled shinobi might be willing to mentor an up-and-coming student in how to perform medical jutsu, or you could make a deal with a missing nin to help them abduct victims for unethical experiments in exchange for them teaching you how to use fuuinjutsu (cough ryuu cough). See downtime rules for more information on how to gain a mentor.

## **Enhancements**

### **Celerity**

All your actions have their Speed reduced by 2\. This functions exactly the same as spending AP to reduce their Speed, and follows all the normal rules for doing so; it can also be combined with AP to lower an action's Speed further.

All your actions have their Speed reduced by 2, but this reduction cannot reduce the speed of interrupts below 3. You may choose not to apply this talent, or only partially apply it, to a given action if you wish.

### **Generalist**

You've got an astonishing array of skills, even for a ninja. You gain any two rank benefits you currently or previously qualified for.

### **Multiple Summoning Contracts**

Ordinarily, a shinobi can only sign a single summoning contract (at least, the ones listed in the PHB--special summoning contracts don't typically count for this). With this talent, you can have multiple\! Not sure how you convinced the various summon animals to be okay with this, but congratulations.

### **Prodigy**

You acquire a single rank benefit. This can be from a rank you've never had, and even one exclusive to another village (such as taking Hunter Nin when you're a Leaf Chuunin).

### **Skill Specialist**

You have an additional XP/200 Skill Points. You may only take Skill Specialist once.

## **Capabilities**

### **Eight Gates**

In the human body, there are eight 'gates' along the body's chakra circulatory system responsible for regulating the flow of chakra, and by extension providing physical limiters to the body for its own protection.

The first time you take this Talent, you gain access to the first 4 Gates, and the second time, the last 4 Gates. However, you cannot take this Talent the second time until 4500 XP.

The second time this Talent is taken, the equation for Wounding from the Eight Gates becomes: (4 \* (Gates Open) \+ (Final Speed) \+ (Half AP Spent))%  

See "The Eight Gates" for more information about how these work.

### **Kage Bunshin**

You learn martial ar--Kage Bunshin no Jutsu\! It's a not-quite forbidden technique, and probably the most powerful of the cloning techniques usable by ninja without advanced bloodlines. Unfortunately, it's also very draining on the user, almost prohibitively so.

See "Kage Bunshin" for the rules for this technique.

### **Summoning Contract**

You've signed a blood contract with one of the various species of intelligent, super-powered animals that ninja are able to call upon. How this happens varies; some shinobi have mentors who, as part of training an apprentice to be their successor, will offer them the chance to sign one of these contracts.

You might also have took the 'natural' approach: a ninja who hasn't signed a contract and attempts to performing the Summoning Technique will instead be "reverse-summoned" to the home of whichever animal species they have the strongest affinity for (which can change over a ninja's life). There, they will usually be given an opportunity to sign a blood contract before being sent back to where they came from.

as described in "Summoning." To actually summon any of the creatures, or use any of the techniques, provided by this talent you first need the C-rank ninjutsu "Kuchiyose no Jutsu." If you have this talent, you may purchase that technique without meeting the normal requirements for learning C-rank jutsu.

### **Medical Training**

Medical jutsu are particularly difficult to learn compared to normal techniques, due to the extreme amounts of precision, and knowledge of the human body, they require.

You got someone to teach you the principles of medical ninjutsu, or were one of the rare few who managed to figure them out yourselves after months of exhausting study. This talent allows you to learn Medical Ninjutsu of D- and C-rank.

### **Natural Chakra**
In addition to the chakra within shinobi--and indeed, in every living being--there is chakra permeating the entire world. Normally, this matters no more to shinobi than the oxygen in the air they breathe. It's possible to learn how to access this natural chakra, which is what you've done with this talent.

Natural chakra use is broken down into three tiers: Enlightened, Senjutsu, and Sage Mode. Each time you take this talent you gain access to one of the tiers, in order; accordingly, you can take it up to three times. All sage modes will be unique depending on the player and require a custom to be taken.

### **Exotic Venoms**

You have access to some of the rarest, most toxic substances in the world: Blood of a golden dart frog, stingers of a blue ringed octopus, berries from the bushes of a deadly nightshade, etc…. As the villages tend to have very small supplies of these venomous materials on hand (if they even have any at all), this usually involves shady contacts or harvesting the toxins yourself.

You cannot take this talent before you have reached the Rank of Chuunin.

### **Seal Training**

Seals as in sealing techniques (fuuinjutsu), not handseals\! These are advanced, highly specialized techniques; they're not necessary to be a ninja, by any means, but they can be useful.

You understand enough about the principles at the core fuuinjutsu to use some of the more advanced techniques. Most of the time, this is because you got someone (a sensei, or a jounin who you did enough favors for) to teach you, but some particularly erudite students are able to piece together what they need to do on their own.

This allows you to learn C- and B-rank Sealing ninjutsu.

### **Master Artisan**

When an Artisan advances beyond the realm of mere proficiency and takes their first steps to mastery, they can finally begin to call themselves a true novice in their craft.Through a combination of natural gifts and the right education (even if self-taught), your talents as an artisan have been brought to a level that surpasses the limits of the everyday tradesman. You’ve become a master of your craft allowing you to create true works of art (Alongside actually useful things, of course).

Your mastery allows you to work with some of the rarest and most valuable materials in the world using the most advanced of techniques. Materials and techniques that other artisans wouldn’t dare to touch or attempt. This comes in the form of giving you access to exclusive and special features within your chosen specialty.

### **Hyper Elements**

The Hyper Elements are a unique, specialized version of their base elements, that only someone with a natural connection to the element, rather than a learned, may choose to try to develop. Even with natural talent, doing so always takes time, effort, and experimentation-and is usually impossible without a good teacher even for the best of shinobi.

These elements, paired with their base element, are as follows:

* Fire\>Blaze  
* Water\>Abyss  
* Air\>Tempest  
* Lightning\>Plasma  
* Earth\>Crystal

Each individual hyper element unlock costs 1 talent point, and you may not unlock the element unless you have an Affinity for it-aptitude does not count, for these purposes.

In addition, each of these Jutsu may be used to modify weapon creation Jutsu, unlike Para-Elementals.
