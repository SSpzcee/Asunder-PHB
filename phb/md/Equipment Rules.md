## **Obtaining Equipment**

Ninja in the Naruto universe have an advantage which real ninja lacked: namely, magical chakra-based powers that let them perform superhuman physical feats, stand on water, and breathe fire.

Even so, a wise ninja, magical or not, will equip themselves with a wide variety of tools. True, you could create a thick bank of fog instead of throwing down a smoke bomb--but that smoke bomb's faster, and less taxing.

Every piece of equipment has a cost in Ryo, the world's most commonly-used currency. You can get Ryo through missions, events, and on character creation where you have 50k to start out with.

Items can be divided into two broad categories: Consumable and non-consumable.

*Consumable* items are gone once you use them once. These are things like smoke bombs, poisons, and explosives. Used-up consumables can be restocked when you get back to your village, if they were bought with Requisition. It is generally unwise to purchase consumables with Savings; if you do, once you use them they are gone forever.

*Non-consumable* items can be broken, destroyed, or lost, but usually aren't. These are things like ropes, weapons, and lockpicks. Ranged weapons are not destroyed on use (hit or miss).

## **Equipment weight**

In some cases, equipment weight will come up. Weights are listed below.

Large Gourd: 66 lb (Full)  
Small Gourd: 16 lb (Full)  
Any melee weapon: 5 to 25 lb  
Any large ranged weapon: 3 lb  
Any other ranged weapon: Trivial  
Poisons: Trivial  
Basic equipment/supplies/unlisted: Trivial

## **Restrictions**
While any ninja can pick up a common sword to wield items of higher power it takes a certain competence. As such the weapons and armor you can utilize are limited by your capabilities:

Weapons: Cannot wield weapon with Artisan points more than Athletics * 2
Armor: Cannot wear armor with Artisan points more than Resistance * 2

Attempting to use an item you aren’t qualified for reduces your accuracies, offenses, and d20s by 2. You also have your fatigue bonuses and damage bonuses halved.

## **Weapon-Specific Actions**

### **Draw Weapon**

(Speed 5\)  
Weapons are typically carried attached to one's person somehow; swords have sheathes, a pair of tonfa might be tucked through belt holsters, a fan could be strapped across your back, and so forth.

Drawing a weapon is retrieving it from wherever you have it stored and placing it in your hands. At this point you can use it to attack, parry, or whatever else you please, the downside being that your hands aren't free for, say, handseals. You may also draw a weapon at the start of combat (when you roll initiative), without taking an action to do so. If you wish, you can draw two weapons as a single Speed 5 action.

Note that you only needed to Draw weapons you intend to hold and use in melee. This Speed to attack with thrown or multi-thrown weapons includes the time needed to retrieve them from holsters.

Be aware: While holding one or more weapons, you can still make basic unarmed attacks. You cannot, however, use Unarmed or Combo jutsu. Grappling is still possible as long as you have at least one hand free.

### **Sheathe Weapon**

(Speed 5\)  
You put a weapon you're holding away, in some secure fashion. If you're holding two weapons, you can put them both away at the same time.

### **Discard Weapon**

(Speed 1, or Speed \+2)  
You drop or toss aside a weapon. Done normally, this is a Speed 1 action. However, it may also be used alongside an Interrupt (such as a defensive ninjutsu technique) by increasing that action's Speed (after AP reductions) by 2\.

### **Retrieve Weapon**

(Speed 5\)  
You pick up a weapon on the ground. This can be your weapon, or someone else's, as long as nobody's currently holding it. You can only pick up one melee weapon at a time with this action, and must be able to physically reach it (which may require you to move first).

You can also pick up DEX/10 used throwing weapons and holster them appropriately.

### **Disarm**

(Weapon's Speed \+4) You use a weapon you're holding to knock an enemy's out of their grasp, usually by hitting it at such an angle, and with enough force, that it becomes physically impossible for them to hold onto it.

This is a basic weapon attack that does no damage, but if it hits you knock their weapon STR/10 yards in any direction (if straight up, the weapon lands at their feet but cannot be retrieved for STR/10 IC). Trying to Parry a Disarm attempt has a \-3 penalty.

Small weapons cannot disarm Large weapons, and Large weapons lack the finesse to be used to disarm at all.

### **Transfer Item**

(Speed 3\) You may transfer any item from your inventory into another person's inventory, as long as you are both at a distance of 0 from each other. Note that these items are not automatically held, so if you were to transfer a Katana to someone else they would still have to take a Draw Weapon action to wield it.

Item modifications made before the transfer are retained-thus, if you poisoned a kunai and handed it over, the kunai would still be poisoned.

Both parties must agree to the Transfer for Transfer Item to function.

## **Weapon Durability**
All weapons have a durability which represents how overuse of a weapon without properly caring for it can cause it to dull, rust, or degrade in any other form. In extreme cases a weapon could even break while in use.

Each weapon you wield has a Weapon Damage Pool (WDP) which has a maximum of your weapon’s durability /+ Dexterity/10. Your WDP begins at 0 at the start of each scene.
 
When you hit with a weapon jutsu or are parried the STM is added to your WDP and Parrying or Blocking an attack with your weapon increases your WDP by the fatigue cost of the attack defended. Once your WDP surpasses your weapons Durability, its Damage Level increases by 1 (see below) and your WDP is reset to 0. The penalties for each level stack additively with each level below it. At the end of a scene the weapons damage level reduces by 2 to a minimum of 0 or its damage level at the beginning of the scene.

## **Damage Levels**

**1** | -1 Damage Dice

**2** | -5% Wounding

**3** |  -1 Parry

**4** | -2 Damage Dice

**5** | -5% Wounding

**6** | +1 Stamina Cost

**7** | Die size reduced by 2, -10% Wounding

**8** | -1 Acc, -1 Parry

**9** | +2 Speed

**10** | The weapon breaks. A broken weapon may be used to perform attacks as the original but has 0 Artisan Points and uses the base stats of 1 size smaller (small weapons cannot be used in this way).
