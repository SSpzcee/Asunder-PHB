# **Requirements**

Kenjutsu is more than just Sword and Whip combat; Kenjutsu techniques go well beyond the realm of what's possible for normal humans, smashing rocks and the like. It's not exactly... easy.
There are three ways to qualify to learn a Kenjutsu technique: the first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you're in good enough physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The second, Research skill rank, sufficient understanding of how the move should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.

Finally, rank: If you're high-enough ranking, you're able to pull enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up for your own shortcomings.

Each rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them differently.

Rank:  
E: Genin  
C: Chuunin,Special Jounin  
B: Jounin  

Athletics:  
D: 4  
C: 10  
B: 20  
A: 30  

Research:  
D: 5  
C: 12  
B: 22  
A: 32  

Thus, if you meet any one of those requirements, you can use the jutsu in question. A Chuunin with 5 Athletics could learn all techniques up to C rank, whereas one with 20 Athletics could learn all techniques up to B rank with a mentor.

# **Stances**
Whenever you use a jutsu with stance shift you immediately enter that stance after it resolves (meaning after the delay). You can end any Stance as a Speed 3, Delay 2 Action. While in a stance using any melee weapon action ends your current stance. 

Your stance is broken in the following ways. This means your current stance ends and you enter the broken stance:

Taking a Major or higher Wound
Using any non-Weapon action or interrupt
Receiving Knockback or Stun greater than your Res/10

For example if you use a jutsu with Stance Shift Heaven, after the attack is made you enter the heaven stance. If you then use a jutsu with earth stance once the attack is made you enter earth stance and your heaven stance ends. Then using a basic weapon attack would end your earth stance. If you have 2 attacks that end their delay at the same time you may choose which attack occurs first for the purposes of stances.

Heaven Stance: 
An offense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held high above the shoulder or head, poised for lethally fast, descending strikes. When you enter this stance, your next weapon attack gains \+2 accuracy. While you remain in this stance you have a -2 to all defenses.

Earth Stance:  
A defense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held closer to the ground, typically around waist height or lower. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack increases its delay by 4. While you remain in this stance you have a +2 to all defenses.

Wrath Stance: 
The fiercest and most aggressive Stance, holding your weapon behind your head for explosive momentum. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack has its delay and speed increased by 2 and gains a \+25% wounding bonus. While you remain in this stance you are unable to dodge or parry, using either breaks your stance.

Void Stance: 
A tricky stance where you hold your weapon sideways to allow for trickier angles. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack gains the benefits of the Feint jutsu. While you remain in this stance any damage your weapon takes is increased by 10\%.

Steel Stance: 
A tactical Stance where the weapon is extended completely forward, maintaining a significant distance between the weapon master and their opponent. When you enter this stance, the next time an enemy enters your weapons reach you may use a basic melee weapon attack as an Interrupt ignoring its delay. While you remain in this stance your speed is reduced by 25\%.

Paper Stance: 
A somewhat unique stance where you point the weapon at your target and hold it on one side of your body. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack becomes a Called Shot with no accuracy penalties, but has its wounding reduced by 15\%.

Broken Stance: 
Your rigorously practiced stance has been broken, and now you find yourself with an unsteady sense of balance, your weapon in an odd angle, and your body completely open to any attacks. You have a \-2 to Accuracy and Defensive Rolls while in this Stance, and if you receive a Minor or higher Wound from an Attack, you automatically fall Prone (As per the Status Condition).

Delay: \+2  
Stance: Heaven/Wrath  

Tags: Club/Chain, Link  

Effects:

Stance Shift: Void

### **Hamukau Kanjin \- Vital Strike**

Whether it be to cut someone's achilles tendon, or to gouge their eye out, weapons have many ways to disable or execute their wielder's opponents. Sneaking past your opponent's defenses and getting in even one good attack can change a fight, or end a life\!

Stamina: \+4  
Damage: \+XdS  
Speed: \+4  
Stance: Paper  

Tags: Polearm/Fan, Link

Effects:
You may give yourself X Accuracy Penalty up to \-(STR/10). For every 5 the die size of your weapon is increased by 2 for this attack.

## **Melee Kenjutsu C-rank**

### **Chakura Nagashi \- Chakra Flow**

A technique which increases the potency of a weapon by running currents of chakra through it to enhance its existing properties or adapt it to a situation. The user must remain in physical contact with the weapon to sustain the flow of chakra, making this only effective with melee weapons.

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Requires: Chakra Control 15  

Tags: Weapon Any

Effects:  
While you activate this technique, choose an element you have affinity for. Your weapon attacks are treated as that element for any ninjutsu defenses and gain a benefit depending on the element. For weapons with the dual tag they share the benefits:

Earth: Your weapon gains Stun 2 or \+1 if the target already has Stun. This also applies to anyone who parries your weapon.

Fire: To determine damage you multiply your attack's damage by its base speed, rather than modified speed.

Lightning: Any damage reduction an opponent has is halved, and you ignore the effects of any armor they're wearing.

Water: Water's inherent fluidity and adaptability give you \+1 Accuracy and \+2 parry.

Wind: The efficacy of blocking is reduced by 30\%, and your damage is considered 20% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds upon your enemies.

Your weapon also becomes able to parry any elemental jutsu weak to its element up to C rank, any elemental jutsu strong against it up to E Rank, and all elemental jutsu neutral to it up to D Rank. 

### **Kousanami \- Cross Wave**

A versatile and elegant technique, although one with an infinite room for mastery. The weapon master brings their weapon up or down in a sequence of diagonal, horizontal, or vertical slashes. This technique gets its name from the figure-eight motion the shinobi ends up drawing with their blade no matter which form their assault takes.

Stamina: +8  
Speed: 15 + (Weapon)/2  
Delay: +3  
Stance: Heaven/Void/Steel  

Tags: Weapon Any, Link

Effects:  
Cross Wave has only a single Accuracy, and is treated as one Attack. However, if the opponent uses a Defense where they roll for a result (such as Dodge or Parry), they must roll twice. Two-Handed weapons do not increase your damage bonus for this technique.

If they fail to defend twice your Attack's Dice Damage is doubled (From, for example, 8d8, to 8d8\*2 or 16d8) with partial success being determined by the first defense. If they only fail once they take the normal damage of the attack.

### **Ni-Tōbun \- Bisection**

Requiring as much brute strength as perfect technique, this attack is a powerful horizontal strike that aims to split the target in half. This devastating blow can cleave through guards, armor, and flesh and bone with equal ease. While simple in theory, the weapon master that is capable of performing such a brutal slash while maintaining perfect edge alignment is widely feared and respected.

Stamina: \+10  
Speed: 15 \+ (Weapon's Speed/3)  
Delay: \+4  
Accuracy: \-2  
Stance: Wrath Stance  

Tags: Slashing

Effects:  
Multiply the Total Damage of this Attack by 2. This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Torso and gains a \-50% wounding penalty. Any wound is applied to both arms and the torso. If you miss this attack gains Stance Shift: Broken.

### **Raikogeki - Thundering Strike**

Drawing your weapon back and then lunging out quickly, you make a precise strike aiming to injure, hopefully cause them to bleed out a bit. Despite the slightly weakened nature of this strike, it's rather unnerving to be poked full of holes.

Stamina: \+4  
Speed: \-4  
Delay: \+X  
Stance: Paper  

Tags: Piercing

Effects:  
X has a max of your Espionage /5. This inflicts Bleed 2 or \+1 if the target already has bleed.

Stance Shift: Paper

### **Goryū Rizumu no Jutsu \- Rumbling Dragon Beat Technique**

(Flavor Text)

Stamina: +7  
Area: PDB  
Stance: Earth/Steel  

Tags: Blunt  

Effect:  
You strike the ground with your weapon and cause a miniature earthquake to spread out and crash into anyone unlucky enough to be inside. For every Yard away from you a target is your PDB is reduced by 2 to a minimum of 0. 

This also applies Rocky Terrain 1 to its area and every consecutive use reduces its delay to zero and halves its speed. Each consecutive use has its Rocky Terrain stack up to a max of 5.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

## **Melee Kenjutsu B-rank**

### **Hashadan \- Blade Breaker**

You deliver an overwhelmingly powerful blow, often an overhead strike, with all the force you can muster behind it; what it gains in force it loses in precision, but its real purpose is to destroy any weapons used by the victim for defense.  

Stamina: \+10  
Speed: \+2  

Tags: Weapon Any (except small)

Effects:  
This is used retroactively after an attack is successfully parried or blocked by a weapon. Your weapon is treated as being 5 times its stamina for the purposes damaging the opposing weapon’s durability.

### **Chakura Nagashi Shuusei - Chakra Flow Modification**

Converting one's chakra to an element other than their affinity is difficult; doing so with chakra flow is even more so, as it requires converting your chakra to the desired element, then reabsorbing it in a continuous stream.

Chakra: \+5  
Upkeep: \+4  
Speed: \+4  
Requires: Chakra Control 25  

Tags: Link

Effects:  
This is added on to Chakra Flow allowing you to use any element which you have an aptitude for. If you have affinity for the element this jutsu has its Upkeep reduced to \+2. Your weapon gains the ability to parry elemental jutsu of 1 rank higher. This also allows you to use Chakra Flow targeting a Bow.

### **Surīburesu To-Resshō - Three Breaths Dissolving Blows**

They say that a true master of the sword is able to cut down anybody, no matter who they were, within the span of three breaths. This technique is an expansion of that idea where the weapon master focuses on striking as many opponents as possible within an equally short time span by dashing through or past them faster than the eye can blink.

Stamina: \+X/3  
Speed: Weapon/2  
Line: 3, X  
Delay: \+5  
Stance: Any  

Tags: Weapon Any

Effects: X has a max of the amount of Yards you can normally move as part of this attack including any bonuses (such as Flash Step). You cannot move with attack normally with this jutsu.

### **Tsubasa Migaku - Blade Honing**

Despite being a fairly simple technique in concept, the precision necessary to perform it effectively, and without damaging one's blade, limits its use to more skilled shinobi.
Focusing chakra along the edge of a bladed weapon, the user creates a 'second', sharper blade of chakra that essentially increases the weapon's sharpness.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: X/2 (round up)  
Speed: 15  

Tags: Utility, Slashing  

Effects:  
X has a maximum of (your Chakra Control skill ranks)/4. One slashing weapon you are wielding gains a X \* 5% wounding bonus. If you are dual wielding you may double this jutsu’s upkeep to have it apply to both weapons.

### **Ryuuketsu Ibara - Bloody Thorns**

This technique coats the tip of a piercing weapon with a thin layer of chakra which reacts to puncturing a victim's flesh. When it does so, the chakra immediately forms a number of small thorns which tear the victim's flesh when the weapon is pulled out. The 'spikes' then return to being nothing but formless chakra, ready for the next attack.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 15  

Tags: Utility, Piercing  

Effects:  
One piercing weapon you are wielding gains Bleed 3 or +1 if the target already has Bleed. If you are dual wielding you may double this jutsu’s upkeep to have it apply to both weapons.

### **Nyoi Bō - Compliant Rod**

A technique named after a fabled weapon capable of growing from the size of a toothpick to a massive 20ft pillar. Modern practitioners are unable to change their weapons to that extent but can flow chakra through their weapons making it more malleable to change at will right before an impact to send their opponents flying.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 15  

Tags: Utility, Blunt  

Effects:  
One blunt weapon you are wielding gains Line: 3, Reach (or increases its current Line by adding them together) and increases any knockback it deals by 5. If you are dual wielding you may double this jutsu’s upkeep to have it apply to both weapons.

## **Melee Knejutsu A-rank**

### **Hien - Flying Swallow**

This technique expands upon the concepts developed when learning the Chakra Flow technique. Instead of altering the nature of chakra flowing through their weapon, the shinobi changes the shape. This is used to expand the striking or cutting surfaces of the weapon with an invisible chakra blade, point, or blunt end.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 10  

Tags: Utility, Melee  

Effects:  
Your weapon attacks gain the following: \+2 reach, its size is increased by 2, and your weapon no longer triggers most On-Contact effects.

If you're using Dual Weapons, Flying Swallow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Flying Swallow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Flying Swallow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Hontō No Seigi - True Justice**

Stamina: \+4  
Damage: None  
Speed: 5  
Delay: 0  

Tags: Melee, Interrupt  

Effects:   
True Justice is used as a Weapon Parry with a +2 Bonus and can be used even while in Wrath Stance. If you successfully defend, True Justice immediately acts as an attack, increasing its Speed and Stamina by 5, and using the results of your parry roll as its Accuracy. The attack used is determined by the stance (if any) you were in ignoring any normal restrictions:

None: Basic Weapon Attack  
Heaven: Falling Moon  
Earth: Rising Sun  
Wrath: Headsplitter  
Void: Wide Swing  
Steel: Tactical Retreat  
Paper: Vital Strike  
Broken: Twisting Stab  

Also on a success this jutsu gains Stance Shift: Any (trumping any Stance Shift the jutsu used may have).

### **Iajutsu - Quick Draw**

Unleashing a blade from its sheathe in the blink of an eye with a sudden slash. A practiced move designed to catch enemies unaware and cut them before they have a chance to counter.

Stamina: \+5  
Damage: \+4dS  

Tags: Sword  

Effects:  
Provided your weapon is sheathed, the first time in battle you use this jutsu it gains Stance Shift: Heaven, the delay is reduced to 0, and the attack's speed is halved, though for the purpose of damage calculations it's treated as its regular speed. Every subsequent use reduces the attacks speed by X and increases its delay by X where X has a max of 5.

### **Uneru Nami - Rolling Waves**

The technique itself is simply a strong upward strike utilizing the weapon’s weight to add more leverage to the attack, either by starting from the ground, or bouncing the weapon off of a different surface (such as a wall, to every bricklayer's dismay) in order to bring it back up with speed. This is especially effective as a counter from an enemies attack.

Stamina: \+6  
Damage: \+6dS 
Speed: 12 \+ (Weapon’s Speed/2)  
Delay: \+4  
Requires: Earth Stance  

Tags: Club

Effect:

Stance Shift: Wrath Stance

### **Puño Tsuki - Fist Strike**

When an opponent enters into their guard a skilled polearm user can twist their weapon to strike the opposite end to regain their distance.

Stamina: \-2  
Speed: \-2  
Delay: \-2  
Reach: \-1  

Tags: Polearm

Effects:  
The die size of your weapon is reduced by 2 for this attack. On a hit you may push your opponent up to 1 \+ the max reach of your weapon.

Stance Shift: Steel

### **Ichi no Hoshi - One Star**

By unfolding their fan only a third of the way, the user creates a small but biting gust of wind that is useful for its capacity to strike at targets far away while wielding a weapon.

Chakra: As Weapon + 3
Damage: As Weapon
Speed: As Weapon
Delay: As Weapon
Range: CHA/4

Tags: Fan

Effects:
This attack uses your ninjutsu accuracy and damage bonus, rather than taijutsu and is treated as a Ninjutsu for the purposes of defending.

### **Kuro Budounoki - Black Vines**

A technique popularized by a Nara who liked to utilize a black-painted Kusari-Gama to strike from the shadows with a weapon when his opponents waited for them to move, you channel a small amount of chakra within your weapon and temporarily disconnect portions of it in order to extend its range beyond what an opponent would expect, grabbing hold and forcibly pulling them back to you for a follow-up strike.

Stamina: + 10  
Range: (Weapon) + NDB * 2  
Speed: 10 + (Weapon)/2  

Type: Chain  

Effects:  
Make a Grab attempt with your weapon; if successful, you then begin a Grapple with your opponent and immediately pull them toward you until they are at Distance 0 with you. You can put them on any ‘side’ of you besides your back (Opposite of the side you attacked towards), if you wish, as part of this process.

Afterward you make a Basic Weapon Attack: If you’re holding two weapons, this can be with either one, using its normal Speed with a bonus of +Xd*, where X is the number of yards you pulled them toward you, to a maximum of double your weapon’s base dice. If you manage to wound your target with this, they take a -2 to their Grapple rolls against you per severity of the Wound (-2 for Minor, -4 for Major, etc), which lasts until the Grapple is broken.
If something prevents their movement toward you (such as being grappled by someone else who resists their movement, being tied up to a tree, or stuck in an Immobility 10 effect), then this technique has no effect other than establishing a grapple (which might end automatically, if they are beyond your normal grapple range).

AP spent to lower this Technique’s speed lowers both the speed you perform it at, Which is used for both the Grab and Attack to determine Valid Interrupts, and the speed for the damage of the Weapon Attack performed.

### **Kage Shuriken no Jutsu - Shadow Shuriken Technique**

The user throws multiple Shuriken at the same time, positioning them in such a way that one or more weapons can hide within the shadow of another in flight, making the lower one(s) virtually invisible.

Stamina: 22  
Speed: 22  

Tags: Fuuma Shuriken

Effects:  
You throw two Fuuma Shuriken, each doing their normal base damage, and using half this technique's Speed to determine how much they benefit from your damage bonus.

If this hits and partial defense does not apply, combine the damage of the two weapons. If it hits and partial defense does apply, one misses entirely and the other does full damage (not reduced by partial defense).

### **Fukumikuchi Hari - Hidden Mouth Needles**

The user is able to summon needles from within their mouth and spit them at their opponents with force comparative to have been thrown. It's useful at point-blank range for catching the opponent by surprise, but becomes predictable with repeated use.

Stamina: \+3  
Chakra: 10 \+ X\*5  
Speed: \-2  

Tags: Senbon

Effects:  
X is the number of times you have previously used this technique in the same battle. This is added to a multi-throw with senbon (which does require you to be able to multi-throw senbon) and becomes an automatic Surprise Attack.

### **Omo Hoshiga - Double Star Fang**

Several enemies running at an archer and getting in close could mean the end for an archer, but luckily you can fend them off! Quickly drawing several arrows out, you load them all into your bow and fire them off in different directions. This would be hard for most people, but luckily you're a ninja.

Stamina: \+ 4\*X  
Damage: \+3dS  
Speed: (As Weapon) \+ 3\*X  

Tags: Bow

Effects:  
This is added to a bow attack allowing you to attack X targets to a max of 3. This jutsu uses half your physical damage bonus.

## **Specialized Kenjutsu C-rank**

### **Hirameku Yaiba - Flash Blade**

Damage: \+7dS  
Speed: \+4  
Requires: Neutral/Earth Stance  

Tags: Melee, Sword 

Effects:  
Make an Initiative Roll, opposed by your opponent's; they have a cumulative \+2 bonus for each time you've used this (successfully or not) in this battle. If you fail, you perform a Basic Weapon Attack attack.

If you succeed, your attack receives the benefits of the Iaijutsu Ability, even if you've used that earlier in battle.

Stance Shift: Heaven Stance

### **Kashiwa no Hishou - Oak Flight**

Circling your weapon over your head over your head, you slam it into your opponent after a few rotations (often after leaping absurd distances into range) and completely daze them. A powerful enough strike put in the right place makes it hard for the enemy to focus on you, or even gives them a bit of double-vision.

Stamina: \+5  
Speed: \+ X/2  
Delay: \+3  
Special: Stun X/5  

Tags: Club  

Effects:  
X is the number of yards moved as part of this attack and your move while attacking is determined using double its usual amount. This attack deals X extra dice of damage +1 per every 3 yards of move with attack remaining.

### **Mawarisuto - Rotation Strike**

Extending out a polearm, you hold one end with both hands then commence whirling and spinning the polearm around yourself in large circles! If it has a blade of some sort, this is even better!!

Stamina: +8  
Damage: +8dS  
Speed: +10  

Tags: Polearm  

Effects:  
You may attack anyone you choose within range 3. If you choose to target only one person with this attack it has \+2 Accuracy.

Chakra: \+3 \+ X  
Speed: \+2  
Delay: Weapon  

Tags: Fan, Link

Effects:  
This is added onto a Fuuton jutsu casted with a fan with X being the rank of the jutsu. Choose Heaven or Earth. Prior to the attack you shift into the chosen stance and remain in that stance until your next action, treating all instances of melee weapon in the stance description as Fuuton. The Chakra Cost of this jutsu modified is dealt to the durability of the weapon as if it were Stamina.

### **Chain Dance**

You begin spinning your weapon in a series of practiced moves all around you, an effective maneuver for warding off enemies and defending from projectiles. 

Stamina: \+5  
Upkeep: 4 \+ X  
Speed: Variable  

Tags: Chain  

Effects:  
This jutsu requires both hands even if your weapon can be used with less normally. You begin spinning your weapon and gain the following effects:  
You may Parry incoming Ranged Taijutsu Attacks as a Speed 0 Interrupt with a +3 bonus.  
Melee attacks against you have their Speed increased by 4  
Every (3 + Weapon’s Delay) IC you can perform a Basic Weapon Attack without advancing your IC and move 3y (you can move before or after the attack). X is the number of times you’ve made this attack.

Stance Shift: Steel

### **Itowotoosu - Thread the Needle**

Attaching Ninja Wire to the end of an arrow, the shinobi fires and uses chakra to alter the course of the arrow in mid-flight. This makes the shot extremely hard to avoid, at the cost of leaving a wire leading back to the point of origin.

Stamina: \+8  
Chakra: 18  
Damage: \+(X/2)dS  
Accuracy: \+X/10  
Speed: \+8  

Tags: Bow

Effects:
This is added on to any Bow attack. X is the distance between you and your target and costs X Yards of Ninja Wire. After this attack is resolved, you are automatically removed from stealth (if you were hidden to begin with).

### **Soushuriken no Jutsu - Manipulated Shuriken Technique**

You connect a thin, nearly invisible wire to shuriken or kunai when throwing them so that you can redirect them mid-air, or even attack people around corners or behind trees!

Stamina: 15  
Speed: 5  

Tags: Ninja Wire, Kunai/Shuriken

Effects:  
This may be activated after you miss with a thrown attack using Kunai or Shuriken. You force your opponent to attempt their defense a second time but the speed of the attack is halved for damage calculations.

This jutsu requires you to have Ninja Wire equal to the range at which you make this attack, multiplied by the number of weapons thrown. This wire become unusable for the rest of combat.

## **Specialized Kenjutsu B-rank**

### **Omae wa Mou Shindeiru - You are Already Dead**

By cutting so fast you can slash a target multiple times before an enemy can even perceive the attack. Then like the sick swordsman you are, you return your blade to its sheathe and watch as all their limbs are cut off. Its name is presumably a reference to some great master who perfected this technique but the name has been lost to time.

Stamina: \+5  
Speed: \+2  
Requires: Iajutsu  

Tags: Sword 

Effects:  
You gain Iai points equal to the delay of this attack. You may use those Iai points to increase the delay of any weapon attack by any amount (including this attack). Any attack that has its delay increased by half its delay or more gains the following benefits:

Attack gain Stance Shift: Wrath (on top of existing stance shifts)  
When the target moves out of range every two AP reduces the delay of all your attacks by 1  
Fatigue rolls for your attacks are delayed until the end of consecutive attacks (So if you had attacks occurring on IC 20, 21, and 25. If there are no actions or interrupts from you or your target that occur in that timeframe, you do not roll fatigue for all 3 jutsu until IC 25).

Stance Shift: Wrath

### **Back Breaker**

Taking a low stance you spin 1-20 times (some people just like to be a bit extra) and slam your weapon into a target smashing through whatever is in its way. Breaking buildings, armor, and especially people.

Stamina: \+7  
Speed: 15 \+ (Weapon Speed)/2  
Delay: \+10  

Tags: Club

Effects:  

Choose one or both:  
If this targets a construct (or someone behind a construct such as Earth Shore Return) first deal the total damage of this attack to that construct. Then the attack's normal damage applies immediately after.

If the target is wearing armor, first deal the total damage of this attack to that armor. Then the attack's normal damage applies immediately after.

Stance Shift: Broken Stance

### **Vlad’s Impalement**

Not exactly the best jutsu to use in a friendly spar. A brutal technique to insert your weapon into a target…and leave it there. Often practitioners carry multiple weapons for this explicit purpose turning their opponent into an improvised weapons rack.

Stamina: \+10  
Speed: \+10  
Delay: \+10  
Accuracy: \-5  
Requires: Void Stance  

Tags: Polearm

Effects:  
This jutsu always deals piercing wounds and increases the severity of wounds it inflicts by 1. After using it you let go of your weapon leaving it in the opponent granting an immobility 2 (which stacks with repeated applications). This can be removed as a Speed 10, Delay 10 action which deals a quarter of the original attack's damage and applies Bleed 8. Until it is removed the needling from wounds it applies are not reduced (but reduce AP gain as normal).

### **San no Hoshi - Three Star**

Opening the fan two-thirds of the way for this attack, the user lets out a strong gust of wind, hopefully blowing their opponents away!

Stamina: 12 \+ 3\*X  
Chakra: \+X\*2  
Speed: \+4  
Delay: \+X  

Tags: Fan, Link

Effects:  
X has a Max of CHA/40. This is added onto any attacking Fuuton jutsu casted with a fan. Take the multiplier in the attack's damage and increase it by X. For example: X is 3, 4d8\*5 becomes 4d8\*8. The Chakra Cost of this jutsu modified is dealt to the durability of the weapon as if it were Stamina.

### **Haganekabe - Swan’s Ascent**

An (according to some) excessively flashy maneuver where you fling your chain at an opponent to feint while jumping into the air. This perfectly positions yourself to recover your chain for a devastating follow up as you come back down, usually involving many spins.

Stamina: \+5 \+ X\*2  
Speed: \-X  
Delay: \+ X  
Accuracy: \+2  
Range: \+10  

Tags: Chain

Effects:  
X has a max of half your weapons speed. As part of this jutsu you jump 5 Yards in the air. For 10 IC or until your next attack, you are immune to any ground-based attacks and environmental effects. Chain attacks made while in the air gain \+10 Range.

Stance Shift: Wrath

### **Haruichiban - First Storm of Spring**

The user of this technique throws multiple oversized
shuriken in quick succession, pausing just long enough between each throw to correct for their opponent's movements.

Stamina: 14 \+ X \* 8  
Damage: (STR/12)d12  
Accuracy: \-3  
Range: STR/3  
Speed: 12 \+ X \* 5  

Tags: Fuuma Shuriken

Effects:  
You throw X Fuuma Shuriken, max of STR/40. If this hits normally, its damage is increased by (X\*20)\%. If your attack misses, lower X by 1, its Speed for damage calculations by 6, and raise its Accuracy by 2. Repeat this until Haruichiban hits or X is 0.

### **Tentai-ite no Jutsu - Celestial Archer Technique**

Every once in a while a shinobi gets it into their head that it would be a good idea to use a bow as their primary method of fighting. This rarely ends well, but the shinobi flair for the dramatic is often powerful enough to override both their good judgement, and any good advice they may receive. This technique was developed by those sorts of shinobi, in an attempt to make their weapon of choice less painfully impractical.
The user concentrates chakra in their arms, speeding up their draw speed and allowing them to subconsciously correct their aim in an instant. The downside is that they sacrifice a great deal of power when doing this--but, as many users of it will assert, the technique is "way too awesome" for that to be a serious concern.

Stamina: 15  
Upkeep: 2 \+ X/2 (rounded up)  
Speed: 6  

Tags: Utility Bow

Effects:  
One bow you are wielding reduces its Accuracy penalty by X to a max of its Accuracy Penalty. The base Speed of your bow is also reduced by X/2.

## **Specialized Kenjutsu A-rank**

### **Mikazuki no Mai - Crescent Moon Dance**

Originally developed in Kiri, the technique has since been
imitated and reconstructed in other villages. The user attacks at high speed, using a pair of clones to attack the target's blind spots; this actually consists of several strikes in quick succession, the user changing location after each and losing themselves among their clones. Understandably, this makes an effective defense against the technique difficult to come up with.

Ideally, this technique is performed using Shadow Clones; other varieties of clones work, though are less effective, and in a pinch a ninja can briefly create the necessary clones as part of the technique, though doing so is draining on their chakra, and the clones disappear immediately afterwards.

Stamina: 30 \+ (Weapon)  
Damage: Four times the normal amount of dice rolled by your weapon.  
Chakra: 30 \- 15 \* X  
Speed: 20  
Delay: 15 \- 5 \* X  

Tags: Sword

Effects:  
X is the number of Shadow Clones you have armed with weapons which can be used with this technique, up to a maximum of 2. Crescent Moon Dance is always considered a surprise attack, and defending against it must be done as if it was half its actual Speed (if you used 5 AP to reduce it to Speed 15, it would count as Speed 8; this would require a Speed 4 or lower Interrupt to defend against Crescent Moon Dance).

Clones used with this technique must have the same weapon you do and be capable of attacking and dealing damage. If you have two or more such clones that aren't shadow clones (such a Rock or Water Clones), X is considered to be 1; X cannot go above without using actual Shadow Clones.

Attempting to parry Crescent Moon Dance requires the defender to roll 2d20.takeLowest(1) in place of 1d20. Ninjutsu-based defenses do not suffer from this limitation.
Crescent Moon Dance cannot benefit from Iaijutsu (or, as a result, Flash Blade), and the wounds it deals are reduced by one category.
Crescent Moon Dance may not have its Speed reduced below its Delay.

### **Meteor Slam**

Circling your weapon over your head over your head, you slam it into your opponent after a few rotations (often after leaping absurd distances into range) and completely daze them. A powerful enough strike put in the right place makes it hard for the enemy to focus on you, or even gives them a bit of double-vision.

Stamina: \+ 5 \+ X/10  
Damage: 2 \* (Weapon \+ X)  
Area: X/5  
Speed: \+ X/7  
Delay: \+ X/7  
Requires: Wrath Stance  

Tags: Club

Effects:
X has a maximum of your Strength. The effectiveness of partial defense is halved against this technique: for every 1 point it misses by, it deals only 10\% less damage. The entire area of this attack becomes rough terrain X/20.

### **Soragui Mikansei - Incomplete Sky Eater**

A rudimentary version of a technique fabled to have been developed by a ninja who reached the peak of the world, only rivaled by the Earth and the Heavens themselves. The user holds their polearm by the end behind theirs and swings it downward with its maximum leverage. The goal of all practitioners is to gain the power and skill to cut the sky itself in half.

Stamina: \+20  
Speed: \+10  
Delay: \+5  
Accuracy: \-2  
Range: Strength/2  
Requires: Wrath Stance  

Tags: Polearm

Effects:  
This jutsu increases the dice rolled by your PDB. This attack applies 2 wounds on different locations.

### **Kadou Kikan - Vortex Engine**

Spinning their fan like a staff user would, this doesn't create an impenetrable defense, instead the fan is twisted to use all that force to create massive wind gusts.

Stamina: 30  
Upkeep: 10  
Area: CHA  

Tags: Fan

Effects:  
While you maintain this upkeep every attacking Fuuton jutsu has its range increased to the Area of this jutsu and gains Stance Shift: Random (rolling 1d10, 1 Broken, 2, Neutral, 3 Heaven, 4 Earth, 5 Wrath, 6 Void, 7 Steel, 8 Paper, 9 Choice of 1-4, 10 Choice of 5-8), treating all instances of melee weapon in the stance description as Fuuton and basic as D-rank or lower.

Additionally, every time you use a Fuuton jutsu you apply knockback equal to the Chakra Cost /5 and the Heavy Winds weather condition is applied in its area for IC equal to its chakra cost. Multiple applications don’t stack and only the longest duration remains.

### **Hidden Chain Duplication**

The user hides their chain (generally within their sleeves) and duplicates it as they send 5 chains careening at their opponent to wrap around their neck and each limb. Another application is to send the various chains spread across multiple targets. 

Stamina: \+15  
Upkeep: 2 \* X  
Speed: \+12  
Delay: \+6  
Range: \+5  

Tags: Chain

Effects:  
The first time this is used in a fight it is treated as an automatic surprise attack. Choose up to 5 total arms, legs, and necks from any number of targets in range with no duplicate limbs/neck targeted. Each location is defended individually but you only advance IC for the highest speed defense declared. For every hit that location is wrapped and takes 25\% of this attack's base damage with a \+50% wounding bonus. 

As a Speed 5 action anyone can attempt to free a wrapped limb (including someone elses) by rolling a contested athletics check. You gain a \+3 for every chain wiped around that target and they gain a +2 bonus for every time they’ve attempted this check.

You may still make attacks using the chain but only against targets with at least 1 location wrapped. Every jutsu cast is split into 5 separate attacks using the rules above, except a wrapped location cannot be defended. Attacks using wrapped chains lose any area if the jutsu had it.

### **Sanjuu Hayate - Three-fold Gale**

With this technique, several shots are fired in rapid succession. With each arrow fired, the archer takes note of the effects of drag and wind speed, as well as their opponent's reaction, and compensates before launching the next arrow. In addition to requiring an incredible degree of focus, this technique is quite taxing to perform.

Stamina: \+ X\*4
Speed: \+15

Tags: Bow

Effects:
This is added on to a Bow Attack and X has a max of 5. You make X attacks rolling Accuracy rolls for each attack. If the opponent chooses to defend they must roll against each separate attack but they only pay the cost for it once. The Speed is divided equally between each attack and each attack has its dice halved.
