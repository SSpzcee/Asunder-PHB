## **Explanation**

The core of a ninja's supernatural capabilities comes from their jutsu--meaning, literally, techniques. These use chakra, either projected outwards or used to amplify one's physical performance, to perform feats that would be literally impossible for a normal person.  
These are divided into three broad categories: taijutsu, ninjutsu, and genjutsu.  
Taijutsu, or body techniques, use the chakra flowing throughout a ninja's body to give them the exceptional speed or strength needed to perform the techniques. They are mostly physical attacks. This includes both unarmed combat, and weapon techniques.  
Ninjutsu, or ninja techniques, use chakra to accomplish what those unfamiliar with them might call magic. These effects range from changing one's appearance to projecting balls of flame, to summoning water from thin air, to healing grievous injuries.  
Genjutsu, or illusion techniques, use chakra to either construct illusions in the environment or to directly affect an enemy's mind and confuse their senses. Of the three, they are the most difficult to learn.

## **Rules**

Each jutsu is a unique action that, once you've learned it, you can perform. All jutsu are divided into five main ranks (E, D, C, B, and A), with S-rank techniques being rare techniques known only to their inventor and perhaps a handful of people that person taught them to.  
Though each rank of each type has special requirements to learn (explained in more detail in the relevant sections), a few broad rules apply. For example, to learn ninjutsu of one of the five elements, you need the appropriate Elemental Aptitude ability.

To learn any jutsu of B-rank or higher you must be taught how to use it (unless you exceed the requirements by 50%). So you would need 30 Athletics to learn B-rank taijutsu without a mentor. See Downtime Rules on how to find mentors.

## **Reader's Guide**

Most of the jutsu entries have a lot of information packed into them. To help make them easier to read, a lot of the common factors are written using shorthand; for example, rather than spelling out "Using this technique requires you to make a Chakra Exhaustion roll against 10", a jutsu would have an entry of "Chakra: 10"  
Below are all the common terms you'll see in jutsu entries, and what they mean.

### **Stamina / Chakra**

The technique's Stamina and Chakra cost, respectively.

### **Upkeep**

Some techniques require a constant expenditure of your energy to maintain; this is what upkeep represents. So long as you maintain these techniques (which typically can be done indefinitely) you suffer a penalty to all Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to that technique's Upkeep. If you're maintaining multiple techniques with Upkeeps, these penalties stack.  
If your total Upkeep exceeds your total bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls (not counting any penalties), you automatically advance a Fatigue level.  
For example, if you had a Chakra Exhaustion roll modifier of \+6+2+10-8, your total bonus would be \+18. If you had an Upkeep of 19, your Fatigue would automatically advance a category, giving you another \+5, for a total bonus of \+23.  
You may end any Upkeeps you're sustaining at will, even when it's not your action.  
You cannot maintain more than one of the same jutsu as a time. This applies even if you are capable of modifying the element of the jutsu.

### **Damage**

The base damage dealt by the technique. You add your damage bonus (multiplied by the attack's modified Speed) to this number.

### **Accuracy**

Some jutsu have bonuses or penalties to accuracy. If there's no entry for this, it uses your normal accuracy.

### **Range**

How many yards away the attack's target can be. In the case of area-of-effect techniques, they can be centered anywhere within this range (and their effects may well extend beyond it).  
There's one special effect associated with Range: If a ninjutsu technique has a Range of "Touch", then it is possible to defend against it with an unarmed parry.

### **Area**

The radius, in yards, of area-of-effect techniques. Some may not use simple circular areas, in which case more details will be provided in the description itself.

### **Special**

Any special effects the technique has. If a status effect is listed here, it's inflicted automatically.

### **Speed**

The jutsu's base Speed.

### **Seal Speed**

The jutsu's base seal speed.

### **Effects**

Any special characteristics of a technique which aren't covered by one of the above categories are listed here.

# **Taijutsu**

## **Requirements**

Taijutsu is more than just hand-to-hand combat; ninjutsu techniques go well beyond the realm of what's possible for normal humans, smashing rocks and the like. It's not exactly... easy.  
There are three ways to qualify to learn a taijutsu technique: the first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you're in good enough physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The second, Research skill rank, sufficient understanding of how the move should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.  
Finally, rank: If you're high-enough ranking, you're able to pull enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up for your own shortcomings.  
Each rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them differently.

Rank:  
E: Genin  
C: Chuunin,Special Jounin  
B: Jounin

Athletics:  
D: 4  
C: 10  
B: 20  
A: 30

Research:  
D: 5  
C: 12  
B: 22  
A: 32

Thus, if you meet any one of those requirements, you can use the jutsu in question. A Chuunin with 5 Athletics could learn all techniques up to C rank, whereas one with 20 Athletics could learn all techniques up to B rank with a mentor.

## **Hands Requirements**

Unarmed jutsu require TWO free hands to use (though basic attacks may still be applied). Grapples only require one, and weapons depend on the weapon used.

## **Weapon Jutsu**

Weapon jutsu are special techniques which can be performed only while using a specific sort of weapon.

All weapon jutsu will have a "Type" entry, where they'll listen a certain characteristic, such as Slashing or Sword.

Only a weapon which meets these requirements may be used with that technique.  
Many of these jutsu will list "As Weapon" in one or more of their entries. For example, if you are using a Stamina 12 weapon, and the technique lists "Stamina: As Weapon \+3", the Stamina cost to use it would be 15\.

If a weapon has a Delay, then any techniques using it also inherit this Delay. For example, using Oak Flight (a technique which normally has no Delay) with a Tetsubo would cause your attack to have Delay 6 (the Tetsubo's normal Delay). If a technique has a Delay of, for example, "As Weapon \+3", weapons without a Delay are treated as having a natural Delay 0 (meaning, in that case, the technique would have Delay 3).

## **Stances**

1. You can switch from a Non-Neutral Stance to a Neutral Stance as a Speed 8, Delay 4 Action.  
2.  Taking a Major or higher Wound while in a non-Neutral Stance will kick you back out of whatever Stance you were in and put you into a Broken Stance.  
3.  While in a Non-Neutral stance, moving at a faster rate than half your movement speed will kick you out of your Stance and put you into a Neutral Stance  
4.  Upkeep given by Stances cannot be reduced or mitigated in any way.  
5.  Using non-Weapon Jutsus kicks you out of your Stance and puts you into a Neutral Stance  
6.  Knockback will put you into a Broken Stance.  
7.  Unless a Weapon Jutsu shifts you to another Stance, you'll be automatically shifted to a Neutral Stance after you perform a Weapon Jutsu or a Basic Weapon Attack.

### **Neutral Stance \[No Upkeep\]:**

This is the Stance every person starts with at the start of Initiative, even combatants that do not carry or use weapons are always considered to be in the Neutral Stance for all purposes. No benefits or drawbacks.

### **Heaven Stance \[Upkeep 2\]:** 

An offense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held high above the shoulder or head, poised for lethally fast, descending strikes. This stance prioritizes quick and lethal offensive potential, allowing the fighter to harness the full force of gravity for devastating blows intended to break through any defenses and dominate opponents. By adopting this stance, the fighter sacrifices much defensive coverage, and limits their movement in favor of maintaining a relentless, high-pressure assault. While this stance requires confidence and precise timing to mitigate its defensive vulnerabilities, it is ideal for warriors who thrive on taking the initiative and overpowering their foes through sheer force and aggression. Gain a \+2 Accuracy Bonus to Weapon Attacks while in this Stance, but take a \-2 Penalty to all Defensive Rolls. 

### **Earth Stance \[Upkeep 2\]:**  

A defense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held closer to the ground, typically around waist height or lower. This stance offers several advantages in combat, providing a strong defense against low attacks while allowing for quick upward strikes and most importantly, ease of movement. Though the upper body may initially appear exposed, with the weapon downwards and the body positioned properly, a master of this technique can easily deflect or parry away an incoming strike and follow it with a deadly cut or thrust all in the same single motion. Additionally, the stance allows for a quick upswing even on conventional attacks when not defending.  The low guard is favored by those who rely on nimbleness of both hands and feet, as it allows for swift and efficient movements while maintaining a solid defense. Gain a \+2 to Defensive Rolls while in this Stance, but take a \-2 Penalty to Accuracy for Weapon Attacks.

### **Wrath Stance \[Upkeep 3\]:** 

The fiercest and most aggressive Stance, characterized by the weapon being held so far behind the head or shoulders that the Shinobi looks like they're twisting themselves apart. All to unleash powerful, descending strikes or wide arcing swipes. The High Guard's philosophy taken to the extreme, this stance embodies maximum effort, allowing the brutish weapon master to deliver devastating attacks with the utmost force and reach that they're capable of bringing forth. Used typically for breaking tough bodies and solid objects alike with a singular, heavy blow. Unfortunately, such winding strikes put a hefty strain on the body and leave it quite open and vulnerable both after and during the execution of a strike as the wind up for this stance is quite slow. This stance is ideal for reckless fighters who thrive on aggression and seek to dominate their opponents with unstoppable, forceful attacks. Gain a 50% increase to your Physical Damage Bonus for Weapon Attacks while in this Stance. But the Delay of all Weapon Attacks is increased by 4\. Additionally, the Final Damage of any Attack performed against you during this Stance is increased by 25%. 

### **Void Stance \[Upkeep 3\]:** 

Less of a proper Stance, and more of a series of memorized responses and follow ups. The Void Stance is the most unique of the Stances in that, while all Stances are meant to facilitate better strikes with a weapon, the Void Stance is the most transitory in nature. The true weapon master will only hold this Stance for a split second as they chain into their next strike before returning to it to follow up with another strike, and so on and so on, in a flurry of endlessly and seamlessly flowing barrages. Only those who favor a quick chain of attacks above all else ever use such an eccentric Stance. Reduce the Delay of your weapon by 6 while maintaining this Stance to a minimum of 0, and the Final Speed of your Weapon Attack is considered \[Amount of Delay reduced by Stance\] lower for IC purposes only, to a minimum of Speed 3\. However, if you are hit by a Damage Dealing Attack while in this Stance, then you take a Stun equal to \[Final Damage/50\] and a Minor Wound or higher is enough to break this Stance and put you into a Broken Stance.

### **Steel Stance \[Upkeep 4\]:** 

A tactical Stance where the weapon is extended completely forward, maintaining a significant distance between the weapon master and their opponent with the weapon serving as a steel (or wooden) barrier between them. The extended weapon serves as both a deterrent and a measuring tool, allowing the Shinobi to gauge and control the distance while remaining ready to counter any incoming attacks or approaching enemies with precise thrusts and swift cuts. The Steel Stance is ideal for those who favor a strategic approach, leveraging reach to frustrate opponents and capitalize on their mistakes with quick, calculated counterattacks. By maintaining this extended posture, the fighter can effectively manage the tempo of the engagement, turning defensive maneuvers into offensive opportunities while minimizing their own exposure to danger. While maintaining this Stance, you may perform a Basic Weapon Attack as an Offensive Interrupt whenever an enemy enters the Reach of your weapon. This Interrupt's Final Speed only counts as half for IC purposes, but you may only use a Basic Weapon Attack as an Interrupt this way once every 10 ICs.

### **Paper Stance \[Upkeep 4\]:** 

Favored by roguish Shinobi and spearmen, the Paper Stance represents the fearsomeness of "soft strength" and, much like a simple paper can slip through one's guard and slice through much harder material to cause a paper cut, supplements a Shinobi's ability to strike at the weak points within their adversary's body with lightning fast thrusts that utterly bypass any defenses the enemy had. While in this Stance, Called Shots do not receive a penalty, you ignore the effects of the Target's Armor with Weapon Attacks, and treat their DR as if it is 50% lower. But the Final Damage of your Attacks is reduced by \-15%.

### **Broken Stance \[No Upkeep\]:** 

Maybe you overcommitted on an attack and whiffed, or maybe that guy (Or gal\!) you went against hit harder than you thought and made you lose your concentration, or maybe it was the footing beneath you feet. Or it could be a dozen other reasons. But eitherway, your rigorously practiced Stance has been broken, and now you find yourself with an unsteady sense of balance, your weapon in an odd angle, and your body completely open to any attacks. You have a \-2 to Accuracy and Defensive Rolls while in this Stance, and if you receive a Minor or higher Wound from an Attack, you automatically fall Prone (As per the Status Condition).

## **Unarmed Jutsu**

Unarmed combat is divided into two largely different branches. Regular Unarmed Combat, powerful moves that once learned can be used to create effects that surpass basic attacks and Combo Unarmed Combat, which consists of linking attacks in succession to create escalating effects until they are cashed in for an empowered finisher attack.

## **Combos**

Combo Jutsus indicate as much in their name (typically being named “\_\_\_ Combo”), or by being in the Taijutsu Combo category. You cannot use a combo jutsu unless the last non-Interrupt action you took was a Combo or Opener; similarly, if your combo is broken (see below), you have to start with a new opener. When you begin a combo, you have a “Combo Counter”– basically, the number of combo moves you’ve strung together. This starts at 1 when you hit with an opener. Each time you hit with a combo, the combo counter increases by 1 to a maximum of 5\.

Each combo will have a combo counter entry; for example, here is Lotus Combo’s: Combo Counter: \+1 Accuracy, \+2d10 damage, \+2 Stamina

This works as might be expected: You multiply those bonuses by the number of Combo Counters you’ve amassed. Thus, if you opened with a Kage Buyou and proceeded to a Lotus Combo, the first hit would have \+1 Accuracy and \+2d10 damage from Lotus Combo (because you’re at Combo 1 after the opener); if it hit you’d progress up to Combo 2, and the next combo you used would have \+2 Accuracy, \+4d10 damage, \+2 Stun, and \+2 Stamina cost.

Some combos or finishers have notation like \+3d\*. These are based on your basic unarmed attack damage to some degree, and the \* in these cases will always refer to the die size of your basic unarmed attacks, based on how much Power Attack you’re using on that combo component, so with all four ranks of Power Attack, for instance, it would be adding d12s.

### **Openers**

Openers are not, themselves, always Combo techniques. However, after an Opener hits, you may launch into a combo (i.e. use a Combo Jutsu). Openers are marked as such in their entry, usually by “Special: Opener.” 

Every Opener has a “Momentum” section which is an effect that will either be added to and modifies every following Combo Jutsu in that specific Combo chain, or grants some sort of benefit to the user for the duration of the Combo. Once that particular Combo is broken for any reason, the Momentum effect ends as well. It is important to note that Momentum effects are only applied to Combos, and do not modify Finishers.

### **Switching Combos**

Once you’ve begun a combo, any other Combo Jutsu is fair game. You could freely alternate between Lion and Lotus combos or any other as you pleased. For the most part, things remain simple. Each move increases your Combo Counter normally, no matter how many times you switch between combo moves. Your Combo Counter bonuses are based only on the move you’re currently using. For example, say you used Kage Buyou as an opener, then 2 Lotus Combos, followed by 2 Lion Combos. This would give you a total Combo Counter of 5, assuming they all hit (1 \+ 2 \+ 2). If your next Combo move was a Lion combo, you’d multiply its Combo Counter Bonuses (+1 Accuracy and \-1 Speed) by 5, giving you a total of \+5 Accuracy and \-5 Speed 

### **Finishers**

The final type of move is finishers. Finishers may be used on their own, but have a special effect if used at the end of a combo. Though they do not receive the stacking effects for consecutive combo hits, they have special effects based on your total combo counters. For example, the Lion Barrage finisher has the following entry: Combo Bonus: \+2d\*X damage For each combo counter you have when you execute Lion Barrage, its damage is increased by 2d\*X.

### **Breaking a Combo Sequence**

When a combo is broken, your Combo Counter is immediately set back to 0, you may not continue using combo moves, and all accrued combo counter bonuses are lost. Combo breaking occurs if any of the following things happen:

* You use any non-Combo Jutsu (even if it’s an interrupt)  
* You take a non-Combo, non-Interrupt Action.  
* You execute a Finisher.  
* You attack a new Target.  
* You are Stunned.

Hitting a clone of your intended target does not count as attacking a new target, and accordingly does not break your combo, however hitting a clone (of any target) does not increse your combo counter.

# **Ninjutsu**

## **Requirements**

Learning ninjutsu is a great deal of work; a ninja has to learn how to mold their chakra, how to convert it to the right elemental nature, then how to properly project it, along with memorizing all the necessary handseals... for each individual jutsu they know.

There are three ways you can qualify to learn ninjutsu of a given rank.

The first is Chakra Control skill ranks: With sufficient control over your chakra it becomes easier to mold it efficiently, and mold the vast amounts of chakra used in higher-end techniques with the appropriate precision. Next is Research skill ranks. You can make up for poor chakra control by knowing how chakra behaves even when you can't control it, and understanding what the technique is trying to accomplish.

Finally, character rank. Once you have enough pull in your village, you can bother the right people to teach you how to use techniques without getting brushed off for wasting their time.

You only need to meet one of those requirements for a given jutsu rank to learn those jutsu. They are listed... below.

Rank:  
E: Genin  
C: Chuunin, Special Jounin  
B: Jounin

Chakra Control:  
D: 5  
C: 15  
B: 25  
A: 35

Research:  
D: 5  
C: 12  
B: 22  
A: 32

## 

## **Elemental Strength and Weaknesses**

All Elemental jutsu follow a strengths and weakness chart that circles back on itself. The strengths and weaknesses go as follows:

Earth \> Water \> Fire \> Wind \> Lightning \> Earth

## 

## **Special Rules**

*Earth (Doton)*  
In the rare situation that there is no earth available (such as on a boat), these jutsu are very difficult to use. A few may remain usable (if, for example, they involve you regurgitating huge amounts of mud, instead of manipulating the environment), but most will not. If you are in such a situation, then you’ll need to supply enough chakra to create the earth yourself and account for this, increasing the base cost of the jutsu used by \+5.

*Fire (Katon)*  
If you ever find yourself completely submerged in water, Katon jutsu won't work.

*Lightning (Raiton)*  
Nothing out of the ordinary here\! This is chakra-based electricity, not real electricity, so it has no special ability to, say, electrocute everyone in contact with water, or anything like that (Though some specific Raiton jutsus DO have similar effects to actual electricity, that is inherent to those jutsus and not the element as a whole).

*Water (Suiton)*  
Water is at a disadvantage among elemental jutsu in that it requires raw material to use (earth techniques do as well, but it's rare to find oneself in a situation without ground).Unless the fight is taking place near a river (a small stream won't cut it) or a lake, or, say, on a boat, it's not going to be from the environment.

Accordingly, most water jutsu tend to be very weak or have limited effectiveness unless the shinobi supplies enough “Gallons of Water”, not to mention quite costly. However, using enough gallons of water can turn an ineffectual technique into quite a fearsome force. Even water, in enough quantity, can be turned into a destructive tsunami. 

Using “Gallons of Water” is quite easy, you simply mention how many Gallons you are investing into a Jutsu when you use it, and modify its “W” (Standing for, you guessed it, Water) variable according to how many Gallons you spent. Though it should be kept in mind that most Suiton Jutsus have a minimum and a maximum amount of Water you can invest into it (Typically displayed like this: 4 \> 12 Gallons of Water), anything more or less and the technique breaks down. If a Technique has a Gallon requirement of 0, that means you may use it without spending any Water on it, though that also means it’ll be quite weak.

There are two primary ways to bring water into a battle where there otherwise is none: the first is to physically carry it, typically in a large gourd (see the Equipment chapter). The other is the D rank Water Creation Technique, which may add Gallons of Water to the Background, making those Gallons accessible to everybody in the battlefield until the Water is used up.

Used water is typically scattered across the battlefield, or evaporates back into the atmosphere as pure chakra, meaning it cannot be used in a technique again--it is lost. 

You can't use water someone else is carrying into battle (Like through a Container), but water in the Background or environment is fair game.

*Wind (Fuuton)*  
Blocking reduces the damage of Wind techniques by only 25%.  
A rare form of combat is using a fan to perform fuuton jutsu. It's not without its advantages: using the fan you can rapidly manipulate wind and infuse it with chakra, removing the seal speed from the technique you're using. However, doing this can be tiring, and as such it adds a Stamina roll with a difficulty of 5 \+ (half the technique's Chakra cost), made at the same time as the normal Chakra roll.  
Oh and if there’s air or any gasses around (Even water has air in it), then you can’t use Fuuton, but… If you’re in a situation like that then you probably have bigger problems to worry about. 

## **Medical Ninjutsu**

One of the few good things the development of ways to control chakra has brought to the world is the appropriately named medical ninjutsu. These are techniques which safely transfer chakra to another person, or use it to accelerate the natural healing process, cure maladies, and otherwise ameliorate suffering and avoid unnecessary casualties.  
Medical ninjutsu also has a darker side. The pioneers in the field learned the secrets of the human body so that they could help people, but more than a handful of infamous missing ninja of the past have found ways to weaponize it, or worse.  
Unless otherwise specified in their descriptions, you may not use any medical jutsu on yourself. For the sake of quick reference, the jutsu a medic may perform on themself are: Vital Repair, Tourniquet Technique, Temporary Suture, and Mystical Palm.  
If any Medical Ninjutsu technique has a listed Upkeep, that Upkeep is paid by the recipient of the technique, rather than the medic; this represents the medic adjusting the flows of that person's chakra to preserve their health. This does mean that those techniques can be voluntarily (or forcibly) ended, though the "Dazed" Wound will specifically not do so. You must meet all listed requirements to learn medical ninjutsu of a given rank.

D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Medicine, Medical Training (talent)  
C: 10 Chakra Control, 15 Medicine, Medical Training (talent)  
B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Medicine, Advanced Medical Training (ability)  
A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Medicine, Advanced Medical Training (ability)

## **Fuuinjutsu**

Fuuinjutsu, or sealing techniques, are, as the name suggests, techniques which use chakra to form specialized 'seals'. They're difficult to use, and have limited combat viability.  
What makes them useful is that these seals are stable. Normally, any sort of chakra-based effect will expire soon after its user stops applying chakra to it, the energy dissipating back into the world. Seals don't, and depending on the individual seal and the skill of the user some can last for decades if left undisturbed.  
The downside is, they're counterintuitive and complicated. To learn fuuinjutsu, you have to meet all the requirements listed for a given rank.

D: 5 Chakra Control, 5 Research  
C: 12 Chakra Control, 15 Research, Seal Training (talent)  
B: 20 Chakra Control, 25 Research, Seal Training (talent)  
A: 30 Chakra Control, 35 Research, Advanced Seal Training

## **Created weapons, enhanced attacks and you\!**

Weapons and ninjutsu that empower taijutsu have a few special effects. First, when created they count as ninjutsu (for cases of chakra rolls and the like), however, when attacking they count as taijutsu. This means they do not gain the bonuses from things such as specialist which empower ninjutsu, they would only gain it from taijutsu. They do count as their element when opposing different elements, however. This applies to dual-elements effects as well. Created weapons only count for their element against element defenses, they do not gain any of the other benefits of being dual-element.

Additionally, elemental weapons may only have chakra flow of their element used on them (for example, a water sword could not have a wind chakra flow). This does mean a dual-element weapon can use either elemental flow (an ice water sword could use wind or water chakra flow). This does not apply to jutsu such as Lightning Blade, which is merely a burst of an element, rather than infusing the element long-term.

For jutsu such as Four Seasonal Wind Palm, which enhance taijutsu, this can cause them to lose the benefits of the jutsu (such as enhanced blocking penetration), unless the element they turned it into had a similar benefit of the same type (for example, Ice retains the 25% block reduction, while Scorch would outright ignore blocking; on the other hand, Magnetism would offer no block reduction at all, as block reduction is not an inherent trait of Jiton ninjutsu).

## **Bunshin**

Bunshin, unless stated otherwise, act 1 IC after they were created. If they were created before the initiative, then they act on their user's IC. Clones can ONLY perform actions listed in their action options (which means only wood and shadow bunshin could perform actions such as meditation), though you can spend AP to reduce their speeds.

Bunshin act on their own IC, separate from their creator, and using them does not increase the user's speed unless explicitly mentioned. As they are separate entities, they do NOT benefit from any jutsu you use that designates you, such as Kage Buyou. They would also count as individual entities for jutsu that can target/avoid a set number of targets. Notably, however, they do not count as allies for the Close Ties, Leader, or Tactician Uniques (Get some real friends instead, loser).

Any bunshin that can take actions (such as through the use of AP, or being independent) can talk. Bunshin that can not take actions cannot.

Should a bunshin fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion check badly enough that it would bring them one or more levels of fatigue beyond the point at which it would normally destroy itself, the technique fails outright in addition to the clone destroying itself. This is effectively just an extension of the normal rules of what happens when someone knocks themselves too far unconscious from the costs of one technique (see the Fatigue section of the Combat chapter).

Unless stated otherwise, all clones share the following rules and options.

Hide Among Clones (Speed 4, or Speed \+6) You pull off a quick shell-game maneuver, confusing your opponents. If they've singled you out from your clones, and you're free to maneuver, you may do this to hide yourself. You roll Stealth against their Awareness skill; success means you've once again concealed yourself. Doing this alone is a Speed 4 action, but it may also be used with another action (such as an attack) by increasing that action's Speed by 6\.

Observe (Speed 4\) Anyone can try to observe you and your clones to try and find a discrepancy, such as the clones not casting shadows or not leaving footprints behind. This allows them to make an Awareness roll against your Chakra Control; if they succeed, they can tell you apart from all your clones, and recognize those clones as such, until you hide among them again.

In the case of getting attacked while you are hidden among your clones there is an order of operations that must be followed listed below:

\- Declare Attack by Attacker  
\- Declare Defense by Defender (But don’t roll anything yet)  
\-Check to see if a clone is hit or you: one is hit when you do not roll a 1 on a 1dx roll where x is the amount of clones \+1. You having 2 clones would mean you roll a 1d3 and you are hit on a 1  
If a clone is hit and not the actual PC, both the attacker and defender advance their ic based on actions declared. (In this case you would not have to pay for Stamina or Chakra costs for techniques you intended to use as the defender and those techniques would also not be used. Any AP spent to make the speed a legal defense is still lost)  
If the defending character is the randomized target, resolve the defenses declared before.

# **Genjutsu**

## **Requirements**

Genjutsu's not easy. In fact, genjutsu is really, really hard, even by the standards of other ninja techniques. Taijutsu and ninjutsu are both, after enough shinobi training, slightly intuitive; and, in the case of the latter, every ninja has an elemental affinity they can rely on to help them out even when they struggle overall.  
Not so with genjutsu. There is no such thing as an 'affinity' for it (though some ninja who seem to have an easier time learning it are occasionally described as such), and it takes a lot work to be able to use it effectively.  
The requirements for using Genjutsu of a given rank are listed below.

E: Genjutsu Training Ability  
D: 5 Diplomacy, 5 Research, and 15 (Diplomacy \+ Research), and Genjutsu Training Ability  
C: 10 Diplomacy, 10 Research, and 25 (Diplomacy \+ Research), and Genjutsu Training Ability  
B: 20 Diplomacy, 20 Research, and 50 (Diplomacy \+ Research), and Genjutsu Training Ability  
A: 30 Diplomacy, 30 Research, and 70 (Diplomacy \+ Research), and Genjutsu Training Ability

Notably, Jounin rank also gives access to C-rank Genjutsu.

## **Special Rules**

Genjutsu relies upon confusing the senses, which is a powerful tool in the arsenal of someone who relies on subterfuge... or even just a shinobi needing an extra edge in combat.  
It's quite possible to realize one's under a genjutsu, but that doesn't give any special ability to overcome its effects ("disbelieving the illusion", so to speak, doesn't actually work).  
On the other hand, it's hard to fool someone again and again with the same trick; each time a genjutsu is successfully used against you in combat, you have a (cumulative) \+3 bonus to defensive rolls against that specific jutsu for the rest of the battle.

There are three ways to break free from most genjutsu: \> Genjutsu Kai, the D-rank Ninjutsu technique. \> If you suffer a Wound of major or higher, all Genjutsu effects applied you end as your mind gets its act back together. \> Many Genjutsu will have upkeeps, durations, or the like. Details will exist in specific jutsu entries.

By their nature, it's hard to realize that one is suffering from the effects of a genjutsu technique. It's possible to be afflicted by a genjutsu that you know and use frequently, with obvious 'tells', and still mistake it for reality--such is the nature of delusions. Most Combat Genjutsu will be discovered after a certain amount of IC after they are used, as detailed in the jutsu themselves.
