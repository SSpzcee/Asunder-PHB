# Requirements

Kenjutsu is more than just Sword and Whip combat; Kenjutsu techniques go well beyond the realm of what's possible for normal humans, smashing rocks and the like. It's not exactly... easy.
There are three ways to qualify to learn a Kenjutsu technique: the first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you're in good enough physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The second, Research skill rank, sufficient understanding of how the move should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.
Finally, rank: If you're high-enough ranking, you're able to pull enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up for your own shortcomings.
Each rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them differently.

Rank:
E: Genin
C: Chuunin,Special Jounin
B: Jounin
Athletics:
D: 4
C: 10
B: 20
A: 30
Research:
D: 5
C: 12
B: 22
A: 32
Thus, if you meet any one of those requirements, you can use the jutsu in question. A Chuunin with 5 Athletics could learn all techniques up to C rank, whereas one with 20 Athletics could learn all techniques up to B rank with a mentor.
Stances
Whenever you use a jutsu with stance shift you immediately enter that stance after it resolves (meaning after the delay). You can end any Stance as a Speed 3, Delay 2 Action. While in a stance using any melee weapon action ends your current stance. 

Your stance is broken in the following ways. This means your current stance ends and you enter the broken stance:


Taking a Major or higher Wound
Using any non-Weapon action or interrupt
Receiving Knockback or Stun greater than your Res/10

For example if you use a jutsu with Stance Shift Heaven, after the attack is made you enter the heaven stance. If you then use a jutsu with earth stance once the attack is made you enter earth stance and your heaven stance ends. Then using a basic weapon attack would end your earth stance. If you have 2 attacks that end their delay at the same time you may choose which attack occurs first for the purposes of stances.

Heaven Stance: 
An offense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held high above the shoulder or head, poised for lethally fast, descending strikes. When you enter this stance, your next weapon attack gains +2 accuracy. While you remain in this stance you have a -2 to all defenses.

Earth Stance:  
A defense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held closer to the ground, typically around waist height or lower. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack increases its delay by 4. While you remain in this stance you have a +2 to all defenses.

Wrath Stance: 
The fiercest and most aggressive Stance, holding your weapon behind your head for explosive momentum. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack has its delay and speed increased by 2 and gains a +25% wounding bonus. While you remain in this stance you are unable to dodge or parry, using either breaks your stance.

Void Stance: 
A tricky stance where you hold your weapon sideways to allow for trickier angles. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack gains the benefits of the Feint jutsu. While you remain in this stance any damage your weapon takes is increased by 10%.

Steel Stance: 
A tactical Stance where the weapon is extended completely forward, maintaining a significant distance between the weapon master and their opponent. When you enter this stance, the next time an enemy enters your weapons reach you may use a basic melee weapon attack as an Interrupt ignoring its delay. While you remain in this stance your speed is reduced by 25%.

Paper Stance: 
A somewhat unique stance where you point the weapon at your target and hold it on one side of your body. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack becomes a Called Shot with no accuracy penalties, but has its wounding reduced by 15%.

Broken Stance: 
Your rigorously practiced stance has been broken, and now you find yourself with an unsteady sense of balance, your weapon in an odd angle, and your body completely open to any attacks. You have a -2 to Accuracy and Defensive Rolls while in this Stance, and if you receive a Minor or higher Wound from an Attack, you automatically fall Prone (As per the Status Condition).
