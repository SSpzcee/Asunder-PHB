# **Genjutsu**

## **Requirements**

Genjutsu isn't easy. In fact, genjutsu is really, really hard, even by the standards of other ninja techniques. Taijutsu and ninjutsu are both, after enough shinobi training, slightly intuitive; and, in the case of the latter, every ninja has an elemental affinity they can rely on to help them out even when they struggle overall.

Not so with genjutsu. There is no such thing as an 'affinity' for it (though some ninja who seem to have an easier time learning it are occasionally described as such), and it takes a lot of work to be able to use it effectively.

The requirements for using Genjutsu of a given rank are listed below. Additionally all Genjutsu require the Genjutsu Training ability.

E: Genjutsu Training Ability  
D: 5 Diplomacy, 5 Research, and 15 (Diplomacy \+ Research)  
C: 10 Diplomacy, 10 Research, and 25 (Diplomacy \+ Research)  
B: 20 Diplomacy, 20 Research, and 50 (Diplomacy \+ Research)  
A: 30 Diplomacy, 30 Research, and 70 (Diplomacy \+ Research)  

Notably, Jounin rank also gives access to C-rank Genjutsu.  

## **Genjutsu Rolls**

When using Genjutsu the caster has their Genjutsu Offense and anyone interacting with it (explained below) must roll Genjutsu Defense to defend against it. Though defense is not always rolled immediately.

[M3] Genjutsu Off: 10 \+ XP/400 + Abilities/Uniques
[M4] Genjutsu Def: 1d20 \+ XP/200 + Abilities/Uniques

All Genjutsu fall under 3 types. Direct, Indirect, and Area which dictates how the illusion takes hold. Each jutsu has a tag of the corresponding type:

Direct: Genjutsu with this tag directly target an opponent affecting only their perception and are imperceivable to others. Choose a target in range, they must roll their Genjutsu Defense vs your Offense.

Indirect: These jutsu often rely on subtlety and usually affect objects. Each jutsu dictates when Genjutsu Defense is rolled, if at all.

Area: Rather than targeting a specific person or object you use a thin layer of chakra to create a zone designed to fool anyone inside. However, they are more fragile and prone to breaking. Each jutsu dictates when Genjutsu Defense is rolled.

Most Genjutsu have a duration, which is the number of ICs you can maintain before the illusion fades away. Any Genjutsu without a duration can last as long as the upkeep is maintained.

Additionally, each time a genjutsu is successfully used against you in combat, you have a (cumulative) \+3 bonus to defensive rolls against that specific jutsu for the rest of the battle.

## **Breaking Genjutsu**

By their nature, it's hard to realize that one is suffering from the effects of a genjutsu technique. It's possible to be afflicted by a genjutsu that you know and use frequently, with obvious 'tells', and still mistake it for reality--such is the nature of delusions. 

All combat Genjutsu detail when the target realizes they’ve been trapped in a genjutsu (which has a maximum of the Genjutsu duration). This comes if the form of Realizes X IC. The X, if applicable, is equal to the users genjutsu offense \- the defenders genjutsu defense roll. Until the target realizes the genjutsu cannot be broken even by the methods below (though if it would have been broken the jutsu ends immediately once they realize).

There are three ways to break free from most genjutsu: 
> Genjutsu Kai, the D\-rank Ninjutsu technique. 
>If you suffer a Wound of major or higher, all Direct Genjutsu on you end as your mind gets its act back together.
> All Genjutsu end naturally, either by its duration expiring or its user no longer maintaining its upkeep. The duration begins after the target realizes they’ve been trapped.

## **E-rank**

### **Mousou Enmu no Jutsu \- Illusory Mist Technique**

Masquerading as a higher-ranked Suiton technique, this creates a light bank of fog which has little effect beyond making the atmosphere a bit chillier. An illusion is then laid on all those present (the user may exclude allies if they wish), tricking them into believing the mist is actually thick enough to be a hindrance.

Chakra: 14  
Upkeep: 2    
Area: 25  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10  
Duration: 70 IC  

Tags: Attack, Direct, Environmental

Effects:  
This applies a -4 visibility penalty and a -2 to all Genjutsu Defense Rolls.

Realize | 5+X IC

### **Senpuku no Jutsu \- Concealment Technique**

This jutsu allows a ninja to conceal small (or sometimes not so-small) items on their person or in their grasp. This is a fantastic technique for smuggling items or transporting them in secrecy, its utility counteracted only by its vulnerabilities.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8  
Duration: 1 Hour 

Tags: Utility, Self, Indirect

Effects:  
This completely hides an object from casual observation. For the entire duration the object must remain close to you (like held or in a belt holster). Against a detailed search, it gives a +5 bonus to any rolls to keep it hidden, and allows the object to hide in plain sight. 

If the object interacts with the rest of the world (such as being touched, taking a swing with a weapon, or using a key to open a door) the concealment ends.

### **Genkoe \- Hallucinatory Voices**

Despite its name, this technique isn't limited to voices, or even auditory hallucinations. It has no effect at all until the victim begins paying a bit too much attention to their surroundings, at which point the technique begins playing tricks on their senses, causing them to see movement at the corner of their vision and gentle sounds just slightly too vague to place.

Chakra: 12  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 12  
Duration: 40 IC  

Tags: Utility, Area

Effects:  
This technique inflicts a \-2 penalty to Awareness rolls and halves the bonus for consecutive search actions, rounded up. (so three searches in a row would give a \+3 bonus instead of a \+6).

Realize | 10 + X \* 2 IC


## **D-rank**

### **Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique**

The user creates an illusion of spinning leaves around the victim, after the leaves disappear, the illusion begins, showing the victim something they'd rather never see, be it a loved one hurt, a monster of their nightmares, or some other such thing. In most cases, it is easy to identify that the image is fake, due to the unlikliness of it occuring, but some images still leave a foul sensation in ones mind.

Chakra: 18  
Range: 25  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 14  
Special: Stun 10 \+ X  

Tags: Attack, Direct

Effects:  
X is the amount the opponent failed their genjutsu defense roll by. After the first time each day a target is subjected to this jutsu the base stun is reduced to 5. Additionally, once per day when a target fails their genjutsu defense by 10 or more they lose a Willpower. If used on a target with 0 Willpower remaining, this technique's base stun is doubled (to 20, or 10, depending on whether or not it's been used on them previously in that battle).

### **Magen: Jigoku Kouka no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Descending Hell Technique**

This illusion causes any afflicted by it to see a massive fireball forming above them which slowly descends. Most prudent shinobi will waste time trying to escape its radius, while those who are more reckless will take the 'attack' head-on, bracing themselves against a blow that never actually comes.

Chakra: 15  
Range: 25  
Area: 15  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 13  
Duration: 20 IC  

Tags: Attack, Area

Effects:  
Everyone within the area must make a genjutsu defense roll or be tricked into believing the fireball is real. At the end of the duration the fireball descends and all affected that are still in the area gain Stun 15. The duration of this genjutsu may be reduced by your ranks in Genjutsu Mastery.

### **Oboro Bunshin no Jutsu \- Haze Clone Technique**

This creates what appear to be ordinary bunshin, even responding and vanishing when struck. However, each time one clone is destroyed another takes its place, typically just out of sight of whoever destroyed its predecessor.

Chakra: 10, \+2 \* X  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 8, \+1 per clone  
Seal Speed: 4, \+2 \* X  
Duration: 75 IC  

Tags: Utility, Indirect, Clone

Effects:  
You create X clones to a max of 3. These function as normal clones, but you are always 'hidden' among your clones (as per the 'Hide Among Clones' action), even after you've been hit by an opponent.

Taking an Observe action has it's speed increased by 2 and allows an opponent to make a genjutsu defense roll with a \-5 penalty. They have a bonus of \+2 to this roll for every time they’d already had to take this roll in this fight. Any time a clone used in this technique is destroyed, another one appears to take its place and this jutsu's upkeep increases by 1.


### **Kasumi Juusha no Jutsu \- Mist Servant Technique**

This jutsu creates clones that phase in and out of the ground as if they were made of a blackish, oil-like liquid. When attacked, the clones regenerate themselves. The clones can be controlled to make it seem as if they're attacking. The user can then time their attacks with those of the clones to remain concealed.

Chakra: 14  
Upkeep: 1 \+ X  
Area: 30  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 12  

Tags: Utility, Area

Effects:  
Choose X targets within the area to roll genjutsu defense. You enter stealth against everyone affected and they have a penalty to find you equal to the amount they failed by. While hidden this way ranged weapon, basic weapon, and unarmed attacks reduce your Stealth TN by 3 instead of breaking stealth. Any other attack reduces your Stealth TN by 3 \* Jutsu Rank instead of breaking stealth. Once you've been found, the clones provide no value and the jutsu ends.

Realize | X \* 3 IC

### **Shinkirou no Jutsu \- Mirage Technique**

This creates an illusion that can fool a person's sight, hearing, or smell--or, with more effort, two of those, or all three. These can be dynamic (such as a flickering fire or a fluttering curtain), but they can't actually interact with anything.

Chakra: 10 \+ 5 \* X  
Upkeep: 2 \+ X  
Range: 20  
Area: 3  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 18  
Duration: 1 Hour  

Tags: Utility, Indirect

Effects:  
You create an illusory effect which can target up to X senses between sight, hearing and smell. Any sight can be seen from any distance, smells recognized from within the distance of the range, and sounds heard within double the techniques area. Anyone who spots the illusion is allowed an Awareness roll against your Diplomacy to determine it's fake. It is automatically determined to be fake if physically interacted with or perceived to come from nothing.

## **C-rank**

### **Shunou Kaimetsu \- Brain Destruction**

This jutsu convinces the victim that they've been grievously injured. Although it causes no actual physical harm, it convinces their mind and all their senses that they've suffered some manner of severe damage.

Chakra: 24  
Upkeep: 2 + 2 \* Y  
Range: 30  
Speed: 20   
Seal Speed: 18  
Duration: 70 \- 10 \* Y IC  

Tags: Attack, Direct

Effects:  
Choose a damage type before Genjutsu Defense is rolled. This technique temporarily deals a random wound of that type with the severity determined by how much their Genjutsu Defense failed. Severe if they failed by 10\+, Major if they failed by 5\+, otherwise Minor. Y is the Severity of the wound.

They suffer all normal effects of this injury, aside from HP loss or unconsciousness, until the genjutsu is broken. Anything that allows healing or ignoring wounds acts as normal and the costs remain even after the jutsu ends.

Anything that directly applies a status such as bleed or fatigue is removed when the jutsu ends. But anything indirectly causing statuses such as increased damage taken or fatigue penalties causing you to advance a fatigue level do remain. Any effect which would cause you to fall unconcious directly from the wound given does so, but you awaken after the jutsu ends.

As per normal wounds, Brain Destruction wounds can break other genjutsu on the victim as per normal, save for itself, though it will break other instances of Brain Destruction, should multiple be applied.

Realizes | X IC

### **Nemuri \- Sleep**

A genjutsu whose greatest limitation is that it requires physical contact, the user places their hand on a target and sends them immediately into a deep slumber. Very nice for infiltration without raising a fuss.

Chakra: 20  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 15, Delay 30  
Duration: 1 Hour

Tags: Attack, Indirect

Effects:  
This can't be used in combat. The target immediately falls asleep until the duration ends. A minor wound is enough to break this jutsu.

### **Kori Shinchuu no Jutsu \- Sly Mind Affect Technique**

This technique warps an opponent's senses and sets them walking in circles, potentially for hours on end, by making it seem to them as if they're walking straight towards their desired destination. Maps, compasses, and paths will all be ineffective--the best someone suffering from this technique can do is hold the hand of someone who's not, or hope they realize that they've passed the same landmark ten times.

Chakra: 18  
Range: 40  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 14  
Duration: 1 Day  

Tags: Utility, Indirect

Effects:  
This technique has no effect in combat, and does not end when the victim is wounded.

Someone affected by this technique will find themselves (and their group if they are guiding) continually walking in circles if they try to travel any appreciable distance (half a mile or more). Every hour, they're allowed a new genjutsu roll against your original result, to see if they notice the effects (although this will not break the technique on its own).

Not even something like following a road will work--they'll wind up wandering off it, the illusion convincing them they're still on the "road."

### **Magen: Kokoni Arazu no Jutsu \- Demon Illusion: False Surroundings Technique**

This jutsu allows the user to change the surroundings around a person subtly, usually used to delay, or force people to walk in circles, unaware that they have stopped going the right way, even messing with one's ability to track the direction they are headed, such as north from south.

Chakra: 17  
Upkeep: 4  
Area: 30  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 25  
Duration: 6 Hours  

Tags: Utility, Indirect

Effects:  
Best used out of combat (anyone who sees this being used will realize it's an illusion), this casts an illusion over an area. This could be making a door appear to be a solid wall, a sign has the wrong number on it, or an intact bridge appears to be broken.

Anyone who encounters your illusion makes a genjutsu roll vs your Offense + 5; failure means they believe it's real, success means they know it's an illusion. Actually getting rid of it requires the use of Genjustu Kai, though the illusion won't affect senses other than sight.

### **Sen'un no Jutsu \- Fog of War Technique**

You trap a target in some manner of in-depth hallucination.  
They may believe that you've run away and think they're giving pursuit, or be convinced that they're locked in combat with you. This technique is often a last-ditch resort to escape from a superior adversary, or bypass someone when there's no time to deal with them in direct combat.

Chakra: 25  
Range: 50  
Upkeep: 15  
Speed: 25  
Seal Speed: 20  
Duration: 30 IC  
Special: Costs 1 Willpower  

Effects:  
The target is essentially removed from combat for this technique's duration. They cannot take actions besides Genjutsu Kai (after realizing). Additionally, this technique is particularly fragile. If the target senses danger (such as from an incoming jutsu, or planting explosives around them) it'll break in time for them to try to avoid it.

## **B-rank**

### **Magen: Jubaku Satsu \- Demon Illusion: Tree Binding Death**

This genjutsu makes its unfortunate victim believe that a large tree has suddenly grown behind them through the use of some manner of ninjutsu, and pinned them against its trunk by exceptionally-strong, chakra-animated branches.

Chakra: 32  
Upkeep: 5  
Range: 20  
Speed: 25  
Seal Speed: 25  
Special: Immobilize 10  
Duration: 80 IC  

Tags: Attack, Direct

Effects:  
Every 20 IC which pass, the victim is allowed another genjutsu defensive against your original roll, with a cumulative \+3 bonus, to realize that this is only an illusion.

Effects which allow someone to reduce immobilization penalties do not apply against this technique.

Realizes | 10 IC 

### **Magen: Tetsuotome no Jutsu \- Demonic Illusion: Iron Maiden Technique**

Chains burst from the ground beneath the victim and wrap around their legs, anchoring them in place, followed by two halves of an iron maiden, either on each side of the victim or in front of and behind them. The iron maiden slams shut with them in it, causing excruciating pain and a slew of debilitating injuries.

Chakra: 24  
Upkeep: 4  
Range: 30  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 30  
Special: Stun 15  
Duration: 60 IC  

Tags: Attack, Direct  

Effects:  
This temporarily inflicts a Minor Piercing wound on every location of the opponent's body (torso, abdomen, both arms, both legs, and Slashing on the head) until the jutsu ends. If the genjutsu roll beats their defense by 10 points or more, this is upgraded to a Major wound on every location, the upkeep increases by 4, the chakra increase by 10, and the duration is reduced by 10.

Realizes: 15 IC

### **Sakki \- Killing Intent**

A side-effect of learning how to control chakra is the ability to sense, and exude, what shinobi refer to as killing intent. More powerful shinobi can project it more strongly, and even send lesser ninja running with just a glance.  
This genjutsu simulates an intense blast of paralyzingly strong killing intent in an attempt to overwhelm its target.

Chakra: 30  
Range: 15  
Speed: 15  
Duration: X  
Special: Stun 5 \+ X  

Tags: Attack, Direct  

Effects:  
You and your target must have line of sight with one another (and neither can be suffering from a visibility penalty of -6 or greater). X is the amount the victim failed their Genjutsu dodge roll by, and until the stun has ended they suffer from Paralysis X/3. The stun is cut short if the jutsu ends early.

Realizes: X

### **Gosaru Tatari \- Five Monkey Curse**

This technique interferes with the victim's ability to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel pain. Admittedly, the last one's an undesirable addition to the mix (in most circumstances), butthe technique makes up for that with its all-around usefulness.

Chakra: 26  
Upkeep: 10  
Range: 30  
Area: 10  
Speed: 18  
Seal Speed: 24  
Duration: 20  

Tags: Attack, Area

Effects:  
This halves (rounding down) all ranks the victims have in Enhanced Hearing and Enhanced Sight, and any abilities dependent upon them (such as Blind Fighting or Genjutsu Awareness).

They also suffer a \-2 visibility penalty (which stacks with any other visibility penalties they may have). On the other hand, their reduced sensory perception allows them to ignore the penalties of any Minor wounds they may be suffering from.

Realizes: 10 \+ 2 \* X

### **Jigyaku no Jutsu \- Time Reversal Technique**

Used on willing or restrained recipients, this jutsu puts the target in a trance like state, and keeps them hypnotized, to uncover forgotten memories or past events. Its often used to uncover important details that have been missed or forgotten on missions, or to help shinobi make 100% accurate reports on the most important of missions, rarely on unimportant missions.

Chakra: 30  
Speed: 30  
Seal Speed: 50  

Tags: Attack, Indirect

Effects:  
This can only be used on helpless or willing recipients and can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. It places the subject into a trance-like state, similar to hypnosis. It causes them to recall any suppressed memories, and can help remember details they might otherwise have forgotten.

Mechanically, this will unravel the effects of the A-rank Sennou Sousa no Jutsu, and gives a +5 bonus to Research rolls made to remember details about a previous experience (such as glancing around a room and needing to recall its contents). It will also uncover any memories suppressed due to trauma or similar causes.

## **A-rank**

### **Kiokure Keiren \- Nervous Convulsions**

This technique partially hijacks the victim's nervous system, reacting in response to anything they do and sending conflicting signals. It's only truly effective in combat, where physical activity is the most spontaneous, and even slightly reduced reaction time can prove fatal. This tends to be exceptionally painful.

Chakra: 35  
Upkeep: 9  
Range: 40  
Speed: 17  
Seal Speed: 27  
Duration: 50 IC  

Effects:  
Whenever you take an Action while under this technique's effects, Y is that action's Speed. You suffer from a Paralyze (Y)/2, which lasts for (Y)*2 IC, applied after your Action is resolved. Every time this effect is activated, you roll another genjutsu defense against the original result. Once you succeed, the genjutsu ends.

Realizes: 5 + X IC

### **Kokuangyo no Jutsu \- Bringer of-Darkness Technique**

This technique specifically targets the victim's eyesight, effectively blinding them and allowing its user to attack with impunity.

Chakra: 36  
Upkeep: 6  
Range: 40  
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 30  
Duration: 0  

Tags: Attack, Direct

Effects:  
This applies a \-10 visibility penalty to the victim and negates any doujutsu the victim may possess. While it's in effect, anyone can attempt to hide from them (even if the victim can somehow reduce that penalty below -6).

Realizes: 10 \+ 3 \* X IC

### **Nehan Shouja no Jutsu \- Temple of Nirvana Technique**

The most powerful version of Nemuri, used for putting a large group of people to sleep. Anybody within fifty meters of the user who fails their Genjutsu dodge is put into a deep sleep. Nothing short of extremely loud noises, being shaken awake, several hours passing, or similar situations will wake them up, allowing victims to be bound, moved, or completely ignored. This move is again, useless in combat.

Chakra: 30  
Area: 50  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 30  
Duration: 1 Hour  

Tags: Attack, Area

Effects:  
This can not be used while in combat. Anyone in the area who fails a genjutsu defense falls asleep. Anyone with less than half the user's total XP automatically fails their genjutsu dodge unless they spend a point of Willpower to be allowed to actually roll it (that roll does not gain the normal effects of benefitting from Willpower being spent on it, unless they spend another point).

Realizes: Instantly

### **Sennou Sousa no Jutsu \- Memory-Concealing Manipulative Sand Technique**

This technique allows the user to alter or conceal the subject's memories. While it's not permanent, the change can be either subtle (believing they were incapacitated and left unconscious, rather than incapacitated and then interrogated), or about as much so as a sledgehammer (erasing the past two days of their memory).

Chakra: 40  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 30  
Seal Speed: 40  

Effects:  
This may only be used on a helpless or willing subject. No matter how extreme this technique is, it can't alter one's subconscious. You cannot forget abilities, jutsu, or your name. You might forget a person you met, but they'd always be slightly familiar.

On a willing recipient, the technique is incredibly potent. It can suppress virtually any amount of a person's memories, and can even be used to alter existing memories or create wholly fabricated ones. 

On a helpless and unwilling target, the jutsu's efficacy is greatly reduced and requires a Genjutsu Defense roll. Up to X hours worth of memories, in the past X days, can be erased. The greatest limitation is the user's knowledge. "Your meeting with the daimyo" could be targeted for erasure, but there's no way of knowing if the target also received secret orders after that meeting. "Finding us here", and "the past few hours" are reasonably common uses.

Although a person could be afflicted with multiple instances of this genjutsu, it can only be applied once per week. Genjutsu kai will not remove this technique, nor will being wounded. When you apply this technique, make a Genjutsu Offense roll. Anyone other than you attempting to unravel it (such as with the B-rank Jigyaku no Jutsu) has to roll at least that high when they attempt to do so, or they won't even notice this technique's presence.

### **Dokushin no Jutsu \- Poison Truth Technique**

This technique traps the victim in a state of dream-like hallucination. In that state, the technique's user can try to pry information from them, in the form of questions, which the subject will then (coherently, and audibly) mumble the answer to.  

Unlike torture, this technique leaves no physical marks, and the victims will not remember what information they revealed or managed to kept secret. It often takes longer than torture to extract usable information, but it's much more reliable because the subject can't lie.  

Multiple, especially consecutive, uses of this technique can leave a victim traumatized without knowing why--indeed, even the users aren't entirely sure what kind of hallucinations the victim experiences. While it's not quite a forbidden technique, using it is considered extremely morally ambiguous.

Chakra: 30  
Range: Touch  
Speed: Variable  
Seal Speed: 50  
Tags: Indirect  

Effects:  
This technique may only be used on a helpless victim, and when used immediately puts them to sleep. The genjutsu user must then focus for the victim's maximum Willpower in hours.

The interrogator asks a question up to twelve words long, and the defender makes a Genjutsu Defense roll:

If the interrogator succeeds, the subject must answer the question truthfully and specifically to answer the question. Then they gain \+2 to all future Genjutsu Rolls until this jutsu ends.

If the interrogator fails, the subject does not have to answer that question. Alternatively, they may spend a point of Willpower and automatically succeed against a given question.

A question fails if they've previously been asked it during that session, its a rewording of a previous question, or if the victim does not know the answer to a question. A person won't begin to regain Willpower (spent defending against this technique, or for any other reason) until at least 24 hours have passed without Dokushin no Jutsu being used upon them.
