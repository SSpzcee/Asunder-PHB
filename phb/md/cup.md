# **Creation Uniques**

### **Analyst**

You like to study everything you can about people, their actions, their routines, as well as everything around you. Your analytic power usually gives you a good grasp of the situation and your surroundings helping you make the best choice possible in a given situation provided you had time to process it. However, taking your time to process the information can make you a little slower than most to move into the offensive. 

You have a \+3 bonus to Awareness, Espionage and Stealth rolls.

You begin combat with half your maximum AP. Whenever you take a Rest action you may increase your rest speed up to 10 gaining 1 AP for every amount increased by this unique.

If someone uses the same type of attack (Katon, Weapon Taijutsu, etc.) in succession you get a \+2 to your Defenses, as well as \+2 AP. The Defense Bonus does not stack.

You take a \-5 to initiative rolls, as you need to take a moment to get an understanding of your surroundings before you can fight effectively.

### **Berserker**

A beast of a ninja you are, and you act like one too\! You get angry easily, and often make rash, terrible decisions out of being bull-headed. At least you're hard to take down when things come to combat (as they often do).

You add an extra STR\*2 to your Vitality, and can fight until you reach \-25% of your max HP.

You may take no Defensive Action (Yes, Blocking OBVIOUSLY counts as Defensive Action, stop asking that!) in response to an enemy's attack. If their attack Wounds you, you can choose which location it hits (unless the attack is a called shot). So long as the attack does not incapacitate you, you can then immediately attack the target as an Interrupt using any taijutsu attack you know, with the following changes: The attack has a +3 accuracy bonus, is made at half its normal Speed (to a minimum of 3), and cannot have its Speed reduced further. This attack must be directed at the person who attacked you. You can only perform this interrupt once per IC.

Additionally, for every 10% of your Vitality that you lose, you gain a 2.5% increase to all Damage.

When you fall below 25% Vitality in combat, you must immediately choose whether to surrender, or to continue fighting. If you choose to continue the fight, you can only stop if you or all of your opponents have been incapacitated, not even them surrendering will placate your frenzy.

### **Competitive**

You always want to win every race, hit the bull's-eye first, and beat everyone in every game you play. In fights, winning is your everything and you are constantly measuring yourself up to your opponent; that can be good, since losing a fight as a ninja may have fatal consequences.

You gain 3 bonus XP for every spar or fight you participate in (Missions do not count)

Whenever you miss with an attack, you become increasingly frustrated and driven to land a solid blow on your enemy. This gives you a \-1 penalty to all your d20 rolls, but also a \+1 bonus to Accuracy, up to a maximum of \-5 and \+5 respectively (attacks with accuracy rolls use the accuracy bonus, not the d20 roll penalty). These both reset to 0 when you hit someone. Additionally whenever you advance a fatigue level you gain 5 AP and \+5 to your next fatigue roll.

### **Defender**

Throwing solid blocks, you've honed your reflexes and worked your bones and tendons hard so that your twitch reflex is all you need to keep yourself safe.

You can use the Block defense as a Speed 5 Interrupt. If you're Stunned when you do this, your Block reduces the incoming attack's damage by 25% less than it normally would. 

You reduce the damage you take by RES/5. Additionally anyone hitting you with a non-ranged Taijutsu attack suffers STR/2 DMG.

When you Block, treat the damage as if it was 20% lower when determining what Wounds you receive. You are considered to be blocking at the Start of combat (as per Defensive Reflexes ability) without incurring any penalties for doing so.

### **Energetic**

Running, jumping, swimming, fighting; none of it seems to tire you out. Eventually you'll wear down, but not until long after your friends are left staggering around and panting for breath. On the other hand, it's hard to sit still and focus, let alone study, when you're more or less hyperactive. 

Your Maximum Ranks in Athletics are increased by 3\.

You have 6 levels of Fatigue instead of the usual 5, and suffer Fatigue penalties (-1 Accuracy, \-2 defenses, and so on) as if you were one Fatigue category lower, while retaining the regular benefits. Additionally, the Rest Action reduces your Stamina penalty by double the value it normally would.

However, your lack of focus gives you a penalty of \-3 on all Skill Rolls except for Athletics and Resistance.

### **Genius**

The term 'genius' has a different meaning to ninja than ordinary people. It's not a measure of intelligence, but rather how easily one can understand the concepts behind ninja techniques. The smartest shinobi alive might not be called a genius, but a Genin using advanced jutsu certainly would. Ninja are just kind of like that.Your natural talent may allow you to be lazy and smug, or it could motivate you on to further greatness. 

The cost to learn jutsu is reduced by a third\! Round up the final cost if necessary.

Additionally you get your first three Talents at 750, 2000, and 3750 XP (instead of 1000, 2500, and 4500), and another 1 Talent Point every 1250 XP thereafter (instead of 1500 XP, normally). 

Finally, you become able to learn D-rank jutsu at 300 XP, C-rank jutsu at 800 XP, B-ranks at 2000, and A-ranks at 3000\. This doesn't allow you to ignore other requirements, such as Abilities or Talents. Additionally, it doesn't allow you to ignore requirements specific to individual techniques (such as the Poison Cloud or Telescope Techniques). You no longer unlock Jutsu Ranks through skills.

### **Juggernaut**

You are a solid, hulking brute. You aren't necessarily tall, but you condition yourself hard and have always had a natural gift at receiving pain\! Massive, solid forearm muscles and tendons, strong shins, you are a rough opponent to face. 

You reduce all damage you take by STR/5, and treat damage as being 20% less for the purpose of receiving wounds. 

You can ignore the effects of one wound you are suffering from; any time you're wounded you may continue to ignore the current wound, or change to the newly-inflicted one.

You reduce any Stuns applied to you by 1+STR/30.

All your movement is reduced by 20%. This applies to your normal movement speed based on AGI, jutsu which allow you to travel (such as Vaulting Leap or Exploding Water Shockwave), and even knockback effects from your enemies.

### **Killer**

You were born to do this. As a ninja, you know all about how the body works. It's a frail bag made of skin, surrounding squishy parts that are easily penetrable. You have either learned the workings of the body, or perhaps you're just a bit more brutal, disregarding the fact that your opponents are living creatures. Whatever way it works out, you are a natural born killer, though sometimes you get a bit caught up in all of it.

Your attacks count as doing 25% more damage for the purposes of wounds, but you may choose to lower the severity of any wounds you inflict by one category.

You can perform Called Shots at no penalty.

You start with five ranks in the Toxicology skill, and replace the limit of the Ability “Anatomical Knowledge” with (Toxicology/4)

Your insidious nature is not without its faults: You take a \-1 on all Defensive rolls.

### **Large**

Your body is muscular, taller, wider, or otherwise... bigger, than other people's. Perhaps you're broad-shouldered and muscular but within the realm of plausibility, or maybe you're a seven foot tall brute; ninja can be downright abnormal.

You use STR/12, rather than STR/15, to calculate your physical damage bonus, and your physical attacks all have \+1 Reach. 

In addition to hitting hard, you're tough to take down: you add (STR+RES) to your maximum Vitality, and (RES) to your maximum HP. 

Finally, you have a \+3 bonus to Stamina rolls.

All attacks that benefit from this unique have their Base Speed increased by 2\.

### **Lucky**

Most things seem to go your way, be it from natural talent or you just happen to pray to the right gods\! Finding money on the ground or seeing the footprints of an enemy ninja, it all comes to you naturally, and easily, as if you didn't have to work for it at all\!

On any non-combat roll (Meaning this can only be done outside of combat), you roll 2d20 and keep the higher one instead of 1d20. Additionally, 2+EXP/1000 times per day you can reroll any roll, or allow a (willing) ally to reroll any roll. You can force an enemy to reroll, but it takes two of your rerolls.

When you have no rerolls left, you take a \-2 penalty to Accuracy and d20 rolls.

### **Naturalist**

You are at one with nature\! Animals like you more, you understand nature like one of them, and your energy is naturally powerful. You also can forage well, notice slight differences in the environment to follow footprints, or even see the handwork ninja leave with their traps\! Perhaps it's because of your attunement, or that you are tempted by your primal urges, either way you are still a great asset. You can use your knowledge of nature to replace most lessons learned in books, however, your attunement leaves you more vulnerable to sense manipulation.

Your Maximum Ranks in Survival are increased by 3, and you gain a \+3 bonus to detect, disarm, or avoid any part of a trap. 

Your ninjutsu damage bonus is CHA/12, rather than CHA/15. 

You have a \+1 bonus to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls per rank of the jutsu you're using (+1 for E-rank, \+2 for D-rank, etc.)

You can use your ranks in the Survival skill in place of Research skill to meet any Jutsu prerequisites with the exception of Sealing, Medicine, and Genjutsu.

However, your maximum Research Ranks are reduced by 3 and you receive a \-2 to genjutsu rolls.

### **Nimble**

You have \+1 Accuracy and \+1 Dodge, as well as a \+3 bonus to Stealth and Athletics rolls. You also move 25\% faster and the reduction to your AoE penalty offered by the Nimble ability would be changed to 3 from 2.

But due to your focus on the swiftness of your blows, the damage from your attacks is reduced by 10\%


### **Small**

You are short, spry, and easily toppled over. The last one's not so good, but your diminutive frame makes it harder for others to keep track of you, while allowing you to squeeze into tight spaces and narrowly dodge attacks. However, this also means you are less sturdy than most.

You have a \+2 bonus to dodge.

Your Dodge Interrupt’s Speed is changed to 1\. If its Speed is somehow raised (such as due to Paralysis) you may still always use it even if it would normally not count as a Valid Defense (Which, if it doesn’t, you oughta really question if your opponent is cheating). 

On the other hand, your small stature makes you quite frail compared to the ordinary ninja: You apply your RES one less time to your Vitality.

### **Skilled Shinobi**

While you don't excel in combat, you're able to grasp the fundamental skills and concepts important to being a ninja. 

You have an extra XP/75 Skill Points to spend, and your skill maximums are increased by 1\. 

However, you have a \-1 Accuracy penalty.

### **Specialist**

You excel in a particular style of ninja combat, and since noticing that strength you have focused on what you are best at. Be it extraordinary kicks, incredible lightning bolts, or masterful illusions, you are a cut above the rest. However, just as you are a specialist in one area, you have another in which you are quite inept.

Choose a Specialty and a Path between Taijutsu, Ninjutsu, or Genjutsu and an Incompetence from the remaining two. You get the following benefits:

\-----------------

Taijutsu Specialist: \+2 Taijutsu Accuracy, \+10% Damage with Taijutsu techniques, \+2 Bonus to Stamina rolls for Taijutsu techniques.

* Path of the Elemental Blademaster: You automatically learn one Weapon Ninjutsu for the element for which you have Elemental Affinity for (choose one if you have more than one). This jutsu has its Chakra cost reduced by 5 and its Upkeep by 1 (if it has any).  
* Path of the Thousand Styles: When declaring an Unarmed Taijutsu attack, you can decide what type of damage your attack deals between Blunt, Piercing or Slashing.

Taijutsu Incompetence: \-2 Taijutsu Accuracy, \+10% Damage received from Taijutsu techniques and you can only learn Taijutsu techniques of 1 Rank lower than you normally could.

\-----------------

Ninjutsu Specialist: \+2 Ninjutsu Accuracy, \-4 Seal Speed to Ninjutsu techniques, \+2 Bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls for Ninjutsu techniques 

* Path of the Geomancer: If you use a non-interrupt Elemental Jutsu from an Element different from the one of your last non-interrupt Elemental Jutsu, you can reduce its speed by 3 as if you had spent 3 AP on it (without having to spend AP on it). (Para elemental jutsu counts as both its components, not a different element).  
* Path of the Savant: If you use a non-interrupt Elemental Jutsu from the same Element as the one of your last non-interrupt Elemental Jutsu, you can reduce its speed by 2 as if you had spent 2 AP on it (without having to spend AP on it). (Para elemental jutsu counts as its own Element).

Ninjutsu Incompetence: \-2 Ninjutsu Accuracy, \+4 Seal Speed to Ninjutsu techniques and you can only learn Ninjutsu techniques of 1 Rank lower than you normally could of any type.

\-----------------

Genjutsu Specialist: \+3 to Genjutsu rolls, \-4 Seal Speed for Genjutsu techniques, \+2 Bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls for Genjutsu techniques 

* Path of the Mindflayer: The first time a person fails a Genjutsu Defense roll against one of your Jutsu, they receive a Stun 3. This does stack with any Stun the jutsu may already possess and it only works once per Jutsu per day per person. 
* Path of the Steel Curtain: Whenever you roll your Genjutsu Defense, if you roll below 5, your roll is considered to be 5.

Genjutsu Incompetence: \-3 to Genjutsu rolls, \+4 Seal Speed for Genjutsu techniques and you can only learn Genjutsu Techniques of 1 Rank lower than you normally could

\-----------------

### **Warder**

You've trained hard to become adept at brushing aside incoming objects that are liable to hurt you\! This is useful for shinobi-related activities such as not dying. 

Your Parry action becomes a Speed 2 Interrupt, and has a \+2 bonus. This also extends to jutsu-based defenses reliant upon Accuracy rolls; those jutsu have their Base Speed reduced by 2, as well. Even so, it cannot be used to reduce an action to Speed 0\.

Additionally, you can parry weapons with your bare hands (catching the blade, striking an opponent's arm to knock their blow aside, and so on), or unarmed attacks with a weapon. 

Your reliance on standing your ground while responding to attacks, however, results in a \-2 dodge penalty.
