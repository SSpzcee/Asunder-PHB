# **Initiative**

## **Initiative Rolls**

Combat begins with all participants making an Initiative roll: 1d20+(AGI)/10. From there, everyone is assigned a number depending upon how well they did compared to one another.

Everyone subtracts their roll from the person who rolled the highest; this is the initiative count they will act on.

For example, Choji, Shikamaru, and Ino are all preparing to fight, and so they roll initiative. Choji scores a 6, Shikamaru a 16, and Ino a 12\. They will act on the following initiative counts: Choji: 16 \- 6 \= 10 Shikamaru: 16 \- 16 \= 0 Ino: 16 \- 12 \= 4

## **Flow of Time**

Combat begins on Initiative Count 0, or "Init 0", or simply "IC 0". Players act whenever their initiative count is reached.

Every action a player can take has a given Speed associated with it. When they take an action, its effects are resolved immediately, and its Speed is added to their current initiative count; that is when they will be able to act again.

For example, if you use a Speed 6 action on IC 5, your action will be resolved then and there. After it finishes, combat will progress to IC 6, other people will take their turns, and so on, until IC (5+6 \=) 11 is reached, when you will be able to act again.

Some effects may lower an Action's Speed. No matter how many such effects are applied, no Action's Speed may ever go below half its Base Speed, rounded up, and no action's Speed can be reduced below 3\. This does mean that an action with a base Speed of 3 or lower may not have its Speed decreased at all.

Actions used as Interrupts are an exception to this, and may have their Base Speed lowered to less than 3\. Action Points can be used to reduce an Interrupt's final speed (before para) to less than 3 (normally, an Action with a Base Speed of 3 or lower cannot have its Speed reduced further).

Every 100 ICs during combat, 30 seconds have passed.

## **Simultaneous Actions**

If two people act on the same initiative count, both of their actions are declared and resolved simultaneously. Thus, you and your opponent will both fully declare and resolve your attacks (you can take turns doing so, for the sake of convenience), but not apply their effects until after you've both done so, at the very end of the IC.

## **Action Points**

One of the things that makes battles dramatic is one or both sides pulling out sudden, unpredicted surprises, and among shinobi that's par for the course. Mechanically, this is represented by "Action Points"; thematically this can be a burst of adrenaline, or the result of you carefully luring your opponent into just the right position for you to counter-attack.

You gain 5 AP every time the Initiative Count reaches a multiple of 20\. You start the battle with zero, and can have up to a maximum of AGI/2.

You can spend AP whenever you take an action. Each AP spent reduces the action's Speed by 1\.

You cannot reduce the speed of an action to less than 3 using AP *unless* that action is an interrupt.

You also cannot use AP to reduce Stuns, Delays or Seal Speeds, because none of these things are actions.

## **Combat Example**

It may help if you read the Actions section of this chapter before reading this example.

Using the example above, we had Shikamaru acting on IC 0, Ino on 4, and Choji on 10\. Shikamaru spends his first action attacking Choji with a Speed 8 punch, meaning he'll act next on IC 8\.

To defend himself, Choji tries to dodge, though fails to do so. He's hit, and takes damage, but dodging pushed his next action back by 2, putting his next action on 12\.

Ino goes next, and begins forming handseals for a potent ninjutsu technique. It has a Seal Speed of 14, meaning she'll be ready to act on IC (4 \+ 14 \=) 18\.

Shikamaru goes again, and uses a simple taijutsu technique with a speed of 12\. Choji tries to dodge again, this time evading successfully. Shikamaru's next action will be on IC 20 (8+12), and Choji's on IC 14 (12+2, because he dodged).

Choji's taking a bit of a beating, but Shikamaru's not hitting hard. He's worried about what Ino might be planning, though (she only had to declare that she was using a Perform Handseals action, not what jutsu it was for), so he disengages and rushes his other teammate, unleashing a powerful taijutsu technique with a speed of 20\. Not wanting to take that kind of hit, Ino tries to dodge, and fails.

Ino has to make a Chakra Control skill check against the damage of Choji's attack divided by 10, plus an additional 10\. She rolls very well, and manages to succeed; had she failed, she would've automatically aborted her handseals action, meaning her next action would be on IC 15 (the attack happened on IC 14, \+1 \= 15), and if she wanted to use that technique she'd need to start over.

Choji's next action won't come until IC 34 (14+20), whereas Ino's jutsu has been delayed until IC 20 (18+2).

IC 20 comes up, and Shikamaru and Ino are both ready to go. It's too late for Shikamaru to do anything about Ino's jutsu; she's already completed the handseals, and this turn she'll be able to use it. Worse yet, he doesn't know if she'll be targeting him or Choji.

If he'd had a little more time--for example, if he'd used a quicker move in place of the taijutsu technique he utilized last--he could declare a Block of a speed that would expire some time after Ino's action, allowing him to reliably defend himself if she chose to target him.

That's not an option, so he goes for a quick punch at her (not wanting to make the same mistake as last time, that'll give him plenty of opportunity to prepare before Choji's next action). Ino uses her technique, a Speed 6 ninjutsu. Both try to dodge the other's technique.

This means that Shikamaru will act on IC (20+8+2) 30, Ino on (20+6+2) 28, and Choji on 34\.

# **Actions**

## **Main Actions**

These are actions that anyone can do in combat, and the rules associated with them.

### **Basic Attack: Unarmed**

(Speed 8, Stamina 5\)

The simplest form of attack, this is a catch all for punches, kicks, headbutts, and any other attack which uses your body to cause harm to your enemy's. This deals (2\+XP/400)d4 damage.

### **Basic Attack: Weapon**

(Speed and Stamina Variable)

This is any ordinary attack with a weapon, from throwing shuriken to swinging oversized swords. The speed is listed with the individual weapon, as is the base damage and Stamina cost.

### **Defensive Basic Actions** 

As an action, you may declare a Defensive Basic Action in which so long as you perform no other Actions or Interrupts, you gain a benefit such as the use of a unique interrupt. A basic defensive action is not in effect on the IC it is declared on.

You can simultaneously declare up to two Defensive Basic Actions as Stands, provided you have access to them. Some Abilities and some Clans will give more options.

### **Prepare Blocking** 

(Speed Variable, Defensive Basic Action)

Blocking is bracing yourself for an attack as effectively as possible, and being on guard to do so at a moment's notice. While you are Prepare Blocking you may use the following interrupt:

Block (Speed 0, Interrupt)
Blocking reduces the damage of unarmed and ninjutsu attacks by 50% and weapon damage by 25\%. Additionally, you can choose the location of any wounds inflicted, except when the attack specifically specifies one location (such as certain jutsu or called shots).

However, blocking multiple times in a row becomes predictable and makes it easier to get around. Every time you block your percentage reduction is reduced by 10\% resetting when you gain AP. Wounds increase this reduction depending on severity: 5\% minor, 15\% major, 30\% Severe, 40\% Critical.

### **Multi-Throw**

(Speed and Stamina Variable)

Anyone familiar with fictionalized depictions of ninja has no doubt seen them flinging a handful of shuriken with pinpoint aim. As this game is about fictional ninjas, it stands to reason that they can do this\! The term, appropriately enough, is "Multi-Throwing." 

By default, you may only throw one type of weapon at once; you could throw 6 shuriken, but not 4 shuriken and 2 kunai in the same action. After choosing your weapon, you decide how many you want to throw. 

You throw at least 2 Small Ranged weapons, up to a maximum of DEX/10. The Speed is 3 \+ (number of weapons thrown)/2, and the Stamina cost is 5, \+1 for every 2 weapons (6 for 2-3, 7 for 4-5, and so forth). Regardless of how many weapons you throw, the minimum total Speed of a multi-throw action is 5--this applies to both its base Speed, and its final Speed after any changes (such as spending AP).

The rolled damage is the total for all weapons thrown; 6 shuriken would roll 6d6. Your damage bonus is increased by \+0.5 for every thrown weapon. So, if you had 60 STR in the above multi-throw, your damage bonus would be (60/15 \= 4, 4 \+ 0.5\*6 \= 4+3 \=) 7\. The attack would be Speed (3 \+ 6/2 \=) 6 and Stamina 8, and have a damage formula of: 6d6+7\*6 If you are multi-throwing shuriken, their \+2 Accuracy is applied only once. 

Because wounds represent severe damage from a single powerful attack, and multi-throws are multiple weaker injuries delivered at once, the severity of all wounds caused by multi-throws is reduced by one category, to a minimum of Minor.

### **Rest**

(Speed 5\)

Resting is pausing to cool down and gather your breath. Since it doesn't directly lead to incapacitating your enemy, most ninja prefer to do this out of battle; however, sometimes pacing yourself is the only way to achieve victory. Every Rest action you take reduces your Stamina penalty (see the 'Fatigue' portion of this chapter) by 1, to a minimum of 0\.

The Speed of the Rest action cannot be reduced or increased in any way, be it Uniques, Status effects or anything else.

### **Perform Handseals**

(Speed Variable, Abort)

Most ninjutsu and genjutsu techniques require the use of handseals, specialized hand signs that direct and mold the flow of chakra. Representing this, those jutsu have a Seal Speed listed in their description. That number, minus your DEX/10, gives you the modified seal speed, which is the Speed of your Perform Handseals action. However, other Speed-reducing effects do not apply to Perform Handseals. A Seal Speed of 0 means that while handseals are required, you can perform them so fast that the time required is negligible.

Perform Handseals actions are necessary to perform most Ninjutsu and Genjutsu. You may forgo part, or all, of your DEX/10 reduction of Seal Speed if you wish (for example, with 40 DEX you could use Perform Handseals action for a Seal Speed 10 jutsu at anywhere between Speed 6 and Speed 10, as you pleased).

Handseals require the use of both hands, and if they're interrupted for any reason you have to start over again. All techniques have their own, unique combination of seals to perform them; this means that you need to declare which Jutsu you are going to perform when you declare the Perform Handseals action.

You can Dodge and perform any actions that do not require hands while performing handseals. If you take damage while forming handseals (between the declaration of your Perform Handseals action and when you actually use the jutsu), you must exceed 10 \+ (damage dealt / 10\) on a Chakra Control skill roll in order to continue. Failure means you automatically Abort your Perform Handseals action.

You must use the Jutsu for which you Performed Handseals as your next action after completing them, any other non-interrupt action will cancel their effect and prevent using the Jutsu.

### **Perform Jutsu**

(Speed and Stamina or Chakra Variable)

Ninja can perform superhuman feats or manipulate the elements to create effects by creating Chakra inside them and channeling it into Techniques. There are three grand categories of techniques or “Jutsu” that Ninja can employ.

Ninjutsu, the techniques that manipulate elements, space and time.

Genjutsu, the techniques that create illusions and manipulate the senses.

Taijutsu, the techniques of enhanced physical combat.

Each Jutsu will have its speed, cost and effects listed under its entry and rules for each category of Jutsu can be found in their respective sections.

### **Move**

(Speed Variable)

For the most part, ninja can move faster than ordinary people. When you actually devote time to moving in battle, you travel (AGI)\*(number of IC spent moving)/50 yards.

Sometimes you may need to close the distance and attack an opponent all at once. This is called the “Move with an Attack” Maneuver. When attacking, you may move towards your opponent a distance corresponding to half your attack's Speed, for free. Thus, if you  needed to rush an enemy and throw a punch at them, and had 25 AGI, as a Speed 8 action you could move up to (25\*(8/2)/50 \=) 2 yards and then use a basic unarmed attack.

Movement is unique, in that you cannot use Action Points to reduce its Speed. Your distance traveled is determined by the actual number of ICs spent on movement.

### **Take The Hit**

(Speed 6, Interrupt)

Taking the hit is the glorious move the stronger person or sensei uses to protect their weaker ally\! You make a dodge roll with a \+5 bonus; if successful, you've leapt in the way of an attack aimed at your ally. If you fail, your ally takes 20% of the damage per point you failed by. (For example: If you fail by 2 points, you'd take 60% damage, and your ally 40% damage). If you are more than one yard away from the person you are attempting to take the hit for, you may take penalties to your take the hit roll. To determine if you do or not, take the attack's Speed, and determine how far you could move (see 'Actions') in that time. If that distance is greater than the distance between you and the person you are attempting to take the hit for, then congratulations, you can take the hit normally. If not, you have a \-2 penalty to your take the hit roll per yard you're short by. "The Nimble" ability reduces this penalty at the same rate it reduces area of effect dodge penalties.

You may use interrupts to defend yourself, up to a maximum Speed of how many points your Take The Hit roll beated the opponent's accuracy, with the exception of Dodge. If your last non-interrupt action before Take The Hit was Blocking (see below) you can use the Block action vs this attack.

Take the hit works as normal vs AOE attacks. You do not take damage twice if both you and the person you are taking the hit for are both in the AOE, however.

You cannot perform a Take The Hit action if you are Stunned or if you are suffering from an immobilization penalty of 10 or more. After you successfully use a take the hit action, you are moved into melee range with the person you used take the hit on.

## **Interrupts**

Interrupts are typically Actions taken outside of your own Turn in reaction to or as a trigger to something that has occurred. There are two types of Interrupts: Defensive Interrupts, and Offensive Interrupts. Offensive Interrupts allow you to retaliate against an enemy outside of your own turn in some form or another, such as cutting them down after parrying their own sword strike. Defensive Interrupts are the actual defenses taken to mitigate an attack. You can only ever use one Defensive Interrupt against a given attack unless otherwise specified.

### **Block (Speed 0, Interrupt)**

Under normal circumstances this action can only be granted by the Blocking action (see above).

Blocking reduces the damage of unarmed and ninjutsu attacks by 50%. However, weapon damage is only reduced by 25%; while it's all well and good to keep a punch away from your vitals, a sword cut is nasty business no matter where it lands.

Additionally, you can choose the location of any wounds inflicted, except when the attack specifically specifies one location (such as certain jutsu or called shots).

### **Dodge (Speed 2, Interrupt)**

The best defense against any attack is simply not being hit.When you dodge an attack you roll 1d20+(AGI)/10, plus any other bonuses to dodge you may have, such as from abilities or uniques, against the attack's Accuracy. Success means you completely avoid the attack and its effects.

### **Parry (Speed 3, Interrupt)**

This entails deflecting an opponent's weapon with your own, or stopping their unarmed attacks with your bare hands. Accordingly, weapon attacks may only be parried with weapons, and unarmed attacks may only be parried if you have at least one hand free to do so. Parrying works similarly to dodging, though uses an Accuracy roll to determine its success.

When something (such as Fatigue) penalizes both Accuracy and defensive rolls (or rolls in general), Parry only suffers the penalty to defensive rolls; if something penalizes only Accuracy, then Parry does suffer that penalty. Basically, it doesn't have to deal with 'double jeopardy'.

The above is the standard parry option but there are more parry options listed elsewhere. A defensive option that uses an accuracy roll is considered a parry and sufferes the same penalties as listed above.

### **Jutsu (Speed Variable, Interrupt)**

Some Jutsu can be used as interrupts to Defend against an Attack. Or, just as frequently, allowing you to retaliate in some shape using an Offensive Interrupt, in fact, Jutsus represent the bulk of Offensive Interrupts in the game. Follow all rules in a Jutsu’s entry to resolve when and how you can use their Interrupt. Jutsu used as an Interrupt still follows all normal rules for using Jutsu.

# **Attacking**

The simplest and most effective way to resolve a conflict is often violence. In some cases, it's the only way. Thus, it behooves any shinobi to be able to, when necessary, incapacitate or kill an opponent.

The first step of attacking is to declare what your attack will be, usually by listing within brackets ( ) the name of the attack, its Speed, Cost, Accuracy, and any modifiers that apply to the attack (such as some abilities), so that the other player knows what defenses they can use against it.

### **Accuracy**

Accuracy is a measurement of how precise your attacks are, represented by a target number (TN) your opponent has to match or beat on their defense roll. Your attack's Accuracy is 10+(DEX)/10, plus any bonuses you may get from abilities, uniques, or the technique you're using.

After you've declared your attack, your opponent will declare and (if applicable) roll their defense. If you hit them successfully, you'll then roll damage.

### **Accuracy Rolls**

Sometimes you'll have to make an "accuracy roll". This is essentially the same as your accuracy, but you replace the base 10 with a 1d20 roll. In other words, it's 1d20+(DEX/10) plus any other Accuracy abilities. When something penalizes both Accuracy and d20 rolls, apply only the penalties to Accuracy; if it penalizes only d20 rolls, however, then those penalties also apply.

### **Damage**

Every attack has a "base damage", a number of dice of a certain size you roll. For example, a basic unarmed attack does 2d4 of base damage. The actual damage formula is, (Base Damage) \+ (Damage Bonus) \* (Speed) \+ (any other bonuses)

Your damage bonus is the value determined by your STR (for most attacks) or CHA (for ninjutsu). The damage bonus is multiplied by Speed to represent that slower, more solid attacks are able to better benefit from your raw power. Some abilities may add bonus damage, but unless they explicitly say so, this does not affect your stat-based "Damage Bonus."

Damage is done to an opponent's Vitality unless stated otherwise, until that reaches 0\. Any overflow, and all future damage, goes straight to their Hit Points.

Unless otherwise noted, any alterations to an action's Speed also affect the Speed the action's damage bonus is multiplied by; faster isn't always better.

### **Damage Mitigation Order of Operations**

1. Any other percent-based (e.g. Para-Elementals) reductions of damage not mentioned below.  
2. Partial Defense (as from Dodge, Parry) if applicable  
3. Actual DR.  
4. Any other non percent-based reductions not mentioned.  
5. Blocking.  
   

### **Delay**

Delay is not, properly speaking, an action in and of itself, but rather a quality certain actions have. For an example of how this might be written, an attack could have "Speed 12, Delay 4". This means that while it would be declared normally on your turn, its effects would take place 4 initiative counts later. The action may be aborted any time up to the last IC of the delay.

For example, using the above attack on IC 10, you would have until IC 14 to abort; on IC 14 itself, so long as you did not abort the attack's effects would be resolved normally, and you would then act again on IC 22\. AP may not be used to reduce Delay except for what’s detailed below.

If a target would exit the range of your attack while it’s delayed you may reduce its delay by paying 2 AP per 1 reduction allowing you to attack instantly as if you and the target were on a simultaneous action.

# **Defending**

Inevitably, you will at some point be attacked. Accordingly, ninja are trained to defend themselves in a variety of ways.

You defend by Interrupting an attack with a valid Defensive Interrupt. When an opponent declares an attack on you, you may then declare your Defense with any Defensive Interrupt you have access to. You declare your defense also in brackets ( ), stating the name of the Interrupt, its Speed, Cost (if any) and any modifiers that apply to the action (such as some abilities or Jutsu).

The below considerations may apply before or after a Defense is declared.

### **Interrupt**

Being able to interrupt is a special quality certain Actions, Abilities, and Techniques have which allows them to be performed in response to another Action, generally an attack directed at the user; for example, most defensive jutsu have this quality.

You may use an Interrupt if the Speed of the interrupt (and in the case of ninjutsu, Speed \+ modified Seal Speed) is half or less that of the Action you're interrupting. This is one instance where you may use a ninjutsu with handseals without having performed the handseals as a prior Action, though you still need to meet all normal prerequisites for it (like having free hands). If the Interrupt is an Offensive Interrupt, then it does not need to abide by the “half or less Speed of the Action you’re Interrupting” rule, and simply works as that specific Offensive Interrupt is described.

The Speed (not counting Seal Speed in the case of ninjutsu) of the Interrupt is added to your next action on the IC.

Actions used as Interrupts may have their Base Speed lowered to less than 3, and Action Points can be used to reduce an actions final speed (before para) to less than 3 (normally, an action with a Base Speed of 3 or lower cannot have its Speed reduced further).

### **Abort**

(Speed 1, or Speed \+1)

Certain actions will say they can be aborted, or just list "Abort" as one of their qualities along with Speed (such as the Perform Handseals action). Aborting may be declared on any initiative count before your next action, allowing you to act on the following IC. When you abort an action, you stop performing it; exactly what this entails will usually be discussed in the individual actions.

Alternatively, you may choose to Abort as part of an Interrupt--for example, aborting Handseals so you can perform a defensive ninjutsu technique. This adds 1 to the Speed of that Interrupt.

### **Partial Success**

Just because you failed to evade a shuriken or deflect a sword slash doesn't mean they struck a vital area. When you make a defensive roll to avoid an attack, for each point you fail by, you take 20% damage. Any status effects that are part of the technique, however, will apply normally.

That can be confusing, so, it's example time\! So you roll a 14 on your dodge, against an Accuracy 15 attack. You failed by 1 point, so you take 20% of the attack's normal damage. Had you rolled a 12, you would take 60% damage. And, if you had rolled a 7 (failing by 8 points), you would take the full 100% damage.

With regards to defensive jutsu: Partial success typically applies to any jutsu which works similar to a dodge or parry. That is, you make a d20 roll, and if successful the attack you are defending against does not hit you. However, if the technique has another effect (such as making a d20 roll, and if you succeed you reduce the attack's damage by a set amount), partial success does not apply. Exceptions to this will be noted otherwise in the individual technique's description.

### **Damage Reduction**

Some effects, such as uniques and clan abilities, provide damage reduction (DR). This reduces incoming damage directly: if you have 10 DR, and an attack does 100 damage, you would only take 90 damage from it.

Damage reduction is applied before Block or Partial Defense and stacks with itself.

### **Armor**

Armor can further mitigate damage, usually by reducing the severity of Wounds that would otherwise be received. Rules for Armor will be listed under each entry for it.

# **Advanced Actions**

## **Genjutsu**

Genjutsu are the mind-affecting, often-illusionary techniques used by ninja. While they can be potent in some situations, they're difficult to use against experienced ninja. Attempting to influence someone with Genjutsu (whether directly, such as a mental attack, or indirectly, casting an illusion over an area and determining if it fools them) is resolved through a set of opposed Genjutsu rolls.

The 'attacker' rolls 1d20+XP/400, and the 'defender' rolls 1d20+XP/200, both adding any bonuses to genjutsu. Some bonuses may apply only to offensive or defensive genjutsu rolls. In these cases, the person using the genjutsu is the 'attacker', and the person trying to avoid being affected is the 'defender'. If the defender rolls lower than their opponent, they suffer the effects of the technique being used.

## **Willpower**

Ninja are capable of incredible feats, and some are truly exceptional, performing astonishing deeds in the face of adversity. While you can be as determined (or not) as you please, Willpower represents your ability to use that determination to push yourself above and beyond your limits.

You can spend Willpower any time you attack, or make a d20 roll, after you've seen the action's normal results. When you spend a point of Willpower, reroll whichever roll it was used on (or, in the case of an attack, make an Accuracy Roll). Willpower may not, however, be used to reroll Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion rolls.

If the d20 result is less than 11, add 10 to it; this is your new result for that action.

You may also choose to spend Willpower after someone else has done so to alter the result of their action. However, any given roll or attack may only have Willpower applied to it one time.

## **Holding Back**

Sometimes you are not aiming to kill your opponent, be it because you are in a friendly spar, testing your subordinates or trying to bring back a target alive. Exerting restraint can be a difficult task, and it does have its limits.

In game terms, any time one of your attacks would reduce an opponent below 0 HP (not Vitality, it's on you to stop attacking once they hit HP if you don't want to hurt them), you can instead decide to leave them at 0 HP (Incapacitated).

Additionally, any time you would apply a Major Wound or higher, you can decide to lower the Severity of any Wound you inflict by 1\. You must declare this before you roll for location (or before your opponent chooses it if they were able to do so).

Should it ever matter, this is the last Wound altering effect that needs to be declared by the attacker before resolving the Wound and allowing the Defender to apply any Wound reducing, negating or ignoring effects.

You cannot Hold Back (either of the above effects) with A or B Rank Jutsu, if you do not want to risk accidentally killing or maiming your target, do not use them.

# **Stealth**

## **Hiding**

Ninja hide. It's sort of their... thing. That said, hiding can be accomplished under one of four circumstances:

1\. Nobody is watching you. Well, nobody you're trying to hide from. This automatically prevents usage in combat, though see the other two situations.  
2\. Everyone you are trying to hide from has a \-6 or higher visibility penalty.  
3\. You are already hidden, and taking another Hide action in hopes of getting a new, higher Stealth TN.  
4\. You use a jutsu which explicitly allows you to hide as one of its effects. Note that when you hide this way, the Hide action itself is reduced to Speed 0\.

Once you meet one of those requirements, you may hide. Hiding is, of course, an action\! When hidden, you may not be targeted by enemy attacks (because they don't know where you are\!). It's possible to be hidden from some people, but not others.

### **Hide**

(Speed 10\)

Make a Stealth skill roll; the result becomes your "Stealth TN" (target number), how hard it is to find you. You are hidden at level 1 Stealth.  
For every time you've hidden in a battle, your future Stealth rolls to hide have a \-5 penalty (the third time you hid yourself, you'd have a \-10 penalty; this applies even if you're hiding with jutsu or other effects).

### **Improve Hiding**

(Speed 7\)

This action may be performed only while hiding at level 1 stealth. You take the time to make sure you're properly hidden and settle into place, moving you up to level 2 stealth.  
In case that wasn't clear, this cannot, by itself, take you from level 2 to level 3 stealth.

### **Shunshin**

Whenever you take an action that enters you into stealth, whether that is the hide action or some kind of jutsu or ability, you may immediately perform the D rank General Ninjutsu “shunshin” as an interrupt in order to move yourself. Ninja don’t like to be predictable after all, doing this in order to prevent enemies from simply nuking the location they were last seen with area affecting techniques.

 

## **Stealth Levels**

There are three levels of stealth, corresponding to different degrees of being hidden. Each level has limitations on what can be done in it; for example, in Level 2 and Level 3 Stealth, you cannot move. Thus, if you were at Stealth 3, and chose to spend an action moving, you would immediately be dropped to Stealth 1\.

You may use any jutsu with the Self tag, ranged taijutsu, or Genjutsu technique without breaking stealth. Any action used while in stealth reduces your Stealth TN by 5 though a sneak attack will break your stealth as normal.

### **Stealth, Level 1**

Stealth 1 is as poorly concealed as you can be while still being unseen by your enemies. Your Stealth TN has no bonus at this rank. You may move and perform surprise attacks, as well as using items and performing Handseals you can also freely perform any Genjutsu while being in stealth. Uchihas cannot however use the instant Genjutsu because it requires the opponent to perceive your gaze

 

Actions that break this level of stealth   
\-Use of surprise attacks and sneak attacks  
\-Any jutsu not mentioned in the Stealth Levels section
\-Any action that doesn't only affect you

 

### **Stealth, Level 2**

Stealth 2 corresponds to being fairly well-hidden, having taken the time to adjust yourself and your hiding spot as necessary--you're not sticking your feet out past the edge of the rock you're hiding behind, for example. From Stealth 2 you may perform surprise attacks, use items, perform Handseals, and prepare and perform sneak attacks. At this level of stealth, your Stealth TN has a \+5 bonus, plus you can freely perform any Genjutsu while being in stealth. Uchihas cannot however use the instant Genjutsu because it requires the opponent to perceive your gaze

 

Actions that break this level of stealth   
\-Taking the move action reduces your Stealth level to 1 

 

### **Stealth, Level 3**

Stealth 3 is as well-hidden as you can be. You are somehow camouflaged, blending into your environment excellently. You may not move or attack, but your Stealth TN has a \+15 bonus.

Actions that break this level of stealth   
\-Any action even those explicitly allowed while in stealth reduces you to Stealth level 2
\-Taking the move action reduces your Stealth level to 1 

 

## **Searching**

Understandably, situations arise when ninja want to find other, hidden ninja.

### **Search**

(Speed 6\)

You look for hidden enemies, using your keen ninja senses.  
When you make this action, roll your Awareness skill and compare it to the Stealth TNs of all hidden enemies. If you get equal to or greater than someone's Stealth TN, you have found them. As far as you're concerned, they're no longer in stealth; they cannot perform surprise or sneak attacks against you, you can attack them, and so forth.  
Every time you use a Search action consecutively (without taking a non-Interrupt action between them) you get a stacking \+2 bonus. Thus, your third attempt to find someone would use your Awareness skill \+4.  
If you are the one doing the hiding, you do not automatically know that someone has discovered your hiding place; until they do something indicating they know where you are (such as attacking you, or running straight at you), you think you're still hidden from them.

### **Point Out**

(Speed 3\)

You indicate where an enemy is hiding, typically by pointing at them and yelling "There he is\!" loudly. This allows anyone else present to make a Search action immediately, as a Speed 0 Interrupt, with an additional \+5 bonus.

## **Actions From Stealth**

### **Surprise Attack**

Any attack you make while hidden is a surprise attack. Performing a surprise attack ends your stealth, as you leap out and attack, or otherwise reveal your location in the process.  
If an opponent chooses to use an Interrupt to defend against your surprise attack, they may not lower its Speed by spending Action Points.

When you use a Surprise Attack on an opponent, before declaring their defense, they make an Awareness check against your current Stealth TN, prior to reducing or eliminating the Stealth TN for having used this attack from Stealth. If they fail, the effective Speed of their defense is doubled for the purpose of how much it advances their IC, but not for whether it is a valid defense. This is not a Search action, so passing the Awareness check does not reveal you, and it neither accumulates cumulative Search bonus nor benefits from it.

When somebody is targeted by a Surprise Attack, their current Action Points are reduced. This occurs before any interrupt is declared in response to the attack, and regardless of the success of any subsequent defense.

To find the amount to reduce, take the speed of the surprise attack and half it. The speed of the surprise attack halved is the percent of someone’s original max AP that the surprise attack reduces it’s target’s current Action Points by.

For example, if I have 37/50 Action Points, and I get targeted by a speed 20 sneak attack, I would reduce my current  Action Points by 10% of my original max Action Points. With an original 50 max Action Points, that means I’d reduce my Action Points 5 ( 50 \* 0 . 1 \= 5 ). This would leave me with 32/50 Action Points. This calculation rounds up.

Non-jutsu attacks with ranged weapons do not end your stealth. However, each time you perform one it reduces your Stealth TN by 5\. If your stealth TN ever reaches 0, you are no longer hidden.

### **Prepare Sneak Attack**

(Speed Variable, Abort)

You take the time to line up a perfect attack. You may abort this action at any time, either as a normal abort, or to make your next action a sneak attack.

To use an action as a sneak attack, the total Speed that you used your Prepare Sneak Attack action for must be at least equal to that of the action you're using as a sneak attack (After all modifications, such as AP). If you take another action instead (such as moving to a new hiding spot, via another use of the Hide action), you lose your opportunity to Sneak Attack.

### **Sneak Attack**

A sneak attack is an improved surprise attack, and as such, all normal rules for surprise attacks apply. Additionally, any Accuracy penalties inherent to the technique or weapon you're using are halved. Penalties from other sources, such as visibility or wounds, are not reduced in any way.

A sneak attack may be used as a special type of Interrupt. You can Interrupt any action, taken by any person, with a sneak attack. They may either complete their action, and be automatically hit by your sneak attack, or call off their action and defend against your attack normally. If they call their action off they do not pay its cost, but their next action is still determined by their action's normal Speed.

Sneak attacks may interrupt other actions as if their Speed was 1/4 its actual value. For example, you have been preparing a sneak attack for 18 initiative counts, when your opponent declares a basic unarmed attack (Speed 8\) against your ally, on IC 80\. You declare a sneak attack interrupt. You use a taijutsu technique which normally has 30 Speed; you spend 14 action points to lower its Speed to 16 (less than your 18 ICs of preparation). It now interrupts as if it was Speed (16/4 \=) 4, which is half of the unarmed attack's 8, making it a valid interrupt. Your opponent would be wise to call off their attack; if they do so, they will not roll Stamina for their attack, they'll have their next action on IC 88, and they can defend with any Interrupt of Speed 8 (16/2 \= 8\) or lower.

### **Genjutsu**

Genjutsu can be used from level 1 and 2 stealth, and unlike other jutsus does not break your concealment. However, it can never be a sneak or surprise attack. Genjutsu techniques which require your opponent to be able to perceive you cannot, for reasons that should be largely self-evident, be used on somebody who you're hiding from.

### **Pre-emptive Bombardment aka AOE in Stealth**

When an opponent enters stealth, you may make an attempt to bombard their last known location with area of effect attacks. Due to player knowledge and character knowledge conflicting, there are some restrictions on when you can do this.

If you want to bombard someone, you need to declare your intent to do so when they enter stealth, or when they target you with an attack from stealth. You must place the center of your area of effect attack’s area on the location they were at when they entered stealth or targetted you with an attack, or if you are using an area of effect that centers on yourself, the location they were at when they entered stealth or targetted you with an attack must be included in the area of your self centered area of effect attack.

When you declare your intent to bombard, you must also declare how many times you are going to bombard. After this, you must continue to bombard the same location until you’ve bombarded the amount of times you declared, until your opponent has exited stealth, or until you have been targeted by an attack by your opponent.

You may also, alternatively, declare you wish to search before you bombard. This can also only be done when your opponent enters stealth, or targets you with an attack from stealth. When doing this you must declare how many times you wish to search before you bombard, as well as how many times you are going to bombard after searching. If you find your opponent before you have done the amount of searches you declared, you do not have to do the rest of the searches, or the bombards.

After you have bombarded the declared amount of times, you may not declare any more bombards until your opponent has either left stealth, or targets you with an attack.

Bombarded attacks get an Accuracy penalty of \-1 ACC for every 3 points your opponent’s current Stealth TN is higher than your most recent Search roll since their opponent entered Stealth, and any AOE penalties they would have taken are reduced by 1 for every 1 point their Stealth TN beats your most recent Search roll. If you have not taken the Search action since your opponent entered Stealth, your most recent Search roll total is assumed to be 0, regardless of bonuses.

If your opponent is able to fully dodge a bombarded attack using a dodge action with no links added even if they rolled a 1 on the die then they do not need to take an action to do so, and avoid the attack automatically as if they’d successfully dodged it. If an opponent retroactively increases the Accuracy of their attack by some means (Willpower, Limit Break, and so on) after you've declared an automatic dodge, and the new Accuracy makes the autododge invalid, you may retroactively change your declared defense to something else.

 

# **Pursuit**

## **Pursuit Basics**

If you and all the members of the squad you wish to form together with are out of combat, or 100 Yards away from any (visible) enemy in combat, you may start a Pursuit. This either reflects you going somewhere, chasing someone, or running away from someone\! You can do this with any number of ninja, but a minimum of 3 is required for a Formation.

There are three important choices you must make when starting a pursuit. If you are being thrown into a pursuit on the fly, read the rules below marked with \+++, otherwise, you first pick a Team Captain, a Tactic, and finally a Formation.

Team Captain \- You nominate one of the ninja in your squad to make the decisions for your group, it is important during a pursuit to do things quickly without thinking, so the Captain delegates commands to others, controlling the actions of the squad.

Once you have chosen your Team Captain, determine your squad's Squad Speed. This is based on the lowest speed of any member of your squad. Many things will add or remove percentages to this. It will come up a lot, so remember this number\!

### **How it Works**

The distances squads can be apart are as follows, and are represented in combat by a number of asterisks. They are also often referred to as degrees:

*(1) Very Close*  
*(2) Close*  
*(3) Nearby*  
*(4) Far*  
*(5) Very Far*

Both Team Captains roll their initiatives, then both teams start Nearby. Any members of either team use techniques to buff themselves at this moment as long as they are Speed 10 or less.

If there were any hidden enemies nearby you start 1 degree closer as the Hunted (or further, if you are the Hunter). Unlike normal combat IC, you each alternate turns, each action listed taking a whole turn. Every turn, you gain 10% Squad Speed at the start. After both parties have had a turn, you both compare Squad Speeds and the higher speed moves a degree in their favor (Hunted move 1 away, Hunters move 1 closer). Gaining or losing speed cannot cause you to go over \+50% or under \-50%, unless otherwise stated. You continue to take turns this way until one party is caught or gets away.

### **Tactics**

The way your team has decided on moving together gives you distinct advantages and disadvantages. The different tactics affect how you build speed and what you can do during a pursuit.

*Force* \- Anytime your Squad Speed would decrease, it decreases by half the percentage. This includes when it changes to another Formation and/or Tactic. You can use the Stop\! action from Close, and the Escape\! action from Far. Your squad cannot be broken.

*Stealth* \- You only gain 5% Squad Speed per turn instead of the standard 10%, but your speed cannot be reduced except by changing Formation and/or Tactic. When you use a Volley you can choose to hit them from the sides or center, or with a \-5 penalty hit them from the back (or front, if you are the Hunter). When you use the Ambush action, you can do it from one degree further away. You also may use a Stealth \-10 in place of any defensive roll.

*Cunning* \- When you gain a percentage speed bonus by any means, you can instead apply it as a penalty to the enemy squad. When targetting a trap, you can choose 2 locations and roll a 1d2, or with a \-5 penalty you can choose which direction you want it to hit from. As the Hunter, this makes your successful volleys knock the Hunted one closer and you can use a volley from Far with a \-10 penalty.

*Speed* \- Your percentage caps are raised to \+100% max speed and \-100% minimum. You gain \+20% passively at the start of each turn instead of the regular \+10%, but any penalty to your speed is twice the amount, and anything that moves your squad in a way other than what you'd like moves you that way twice the amount. This includes when it changes to another Formation or Tactic.

### **Formation**

The actual formation your squad moves in has vulnerabilities and strengths of its own. If a formation is hit from its vulnerable side, it is Broken until the squad assumes a new formation. Any bonus you gain from a formation gains an additional \+1 for every member you have over 3 in your squad.

*Line* \- Running in a line, one man leading single-file all the way to the end. You get a \+5 to any Athletics and Resistance roll and you are vulnerable to flanking. (The Side)

*Cross* \- The group is in a short line, with people branching out from the front to cover the sides. You get \+5 Stealth. Vulnerable to an attack from above. (The Back)

*Circular* \- The group covers a nice area, seeing all around them equally. You get \+5 to any Awareness and Survival checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to direct assault. (Center)

*V-Shaped* \- One ninja in the front, then fanning out to both sides. You get \+5 to any Espionage checks your squad makes and you are vulnerable to rear assault. (The Front)

*Broken* \- This is what your squad counts as if it has less than 3 members, or something causes it to break. You no longer gain a passive \+10% speed per turn. If for some reason you cannot decide on a squad leader, you are similiarly Broken.

If you were forced into a pursuit, either by fleeing from an enemy, or from an enemy fleeing from you, there is a special way to handle this\! First, both teams get \-50% Squad Speed for it being so abrupt. After rolling initiatives, starting with the Team Captains, the teams take turns voting on a Strategy and Tactic. First the Team Captain from the Squad that won initiative votes, then the other team's Captain and one other member vote, then two from the original team, then alternating two members until there are none left. At the end, the Hunter's Team Captain chooses a Strategy and Tactic. For every vote they had for the ones they end up choosing, they get \+10% Speed. (This means if two members of your team voted for Force and V-Shaped, and you voted for some different ones, but chose Force and V-Shaped, you'd get \+40% Squad Speed\! 2 Votes for Force \+ 2 Votes for V-Shaped) The Hunted chooses this as well, afterward, then the Pursuit begins.

## **Actions in a Pursuit**

There are two groups in a Pursuit, the Hunted (the ones being chased) and the Hunter (the ones chasing). There are some actions they can both take and some actions only the Hunter or Hunted can take. Any action which calls for a skill roll uses the highest skill roll in your squad, and only their roll. Any attack done by the Hunter can target the back of the Hunted squad, or the center. Any attack done by the Hunted can target the front of the Hunter squad, or the center.

### **General Actions**

*Change Tactic / Formation*

(-30% Squad Speed)  
Doing this causes you to choose a new Tactic and/or Formation, but you lose 30% Squad Speed.

*Press On*

(+20% Squad Speed)  
You gain a \+20% bonus to your Squad Speed.

*Taijutsu Volley*

(Speed 10, \-10% Squad Speed)

This is (for the purposes of damage only) a Speed 10 attack with (Athletics Ranks/5)d12, with physical damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by 10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, its damage being dealt to the whole enemy Squad, and its strike is an Athletics vs. Athletics or Resistance. You can choose to do either Slashing, Piercing, or Blunt wounds with this. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the front. You can choose to make your Athletics check at a \-5 penalty to roll \[1d4\] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)

*Ninjutsu Volley*

(Speed 10, \-10% Squad Speed)

This is (for the purposes of damage only) a Speed 10 attack with (Chakra Control Ranks/5)d12, with ninjutsu damage bonus. Being hit by a volley lowers your Squad Speed by 10%. This can hit anyone up to Nearby, its damage is dealt to the whole enemy Squad, and its strike is a Chakra Control vs. Athletics or Resistance. You can choose any element someone in your squad can use for wounds. When you attack with this, as the Hunter you hit the Hunted from the back, and the Hunted use this to hit the Hunter from the front. You can choose to make your Chakra Control check at a \-5 penalty to roll \[1d4\] and hit the enemy from a random location. (1=Center, 2=Back, 3=Front, 4=Sides)

*Illusionary Assault*

(Requires (3) Nearby)

You can lower the bonus percentage cap a squad can benefit from for their next turn. (A squad that could move \+50% faster can now only get to \+25% faster) If you lose speed from this, you do not gain it back when your cap returns to normal. This is a standard Genjutsu roll, using the highest from both squads. This can be done from Nearby.

*Ambush*

(Requires at least (2) Close)

As the Hunter, you need to have successfully sent a member to Cut-Off the enemy. You can then use this if you're at least Close range. As Hunted you need to use it while they are Close or further away. Roll a Stealth vs. Awareness (this is at a \-10 if you are the Hunted), if you succeed, you get into Ambush position and you start combat, with each member who was part of the Ambush starting in Level 2 Stealth, with a \+10 bonus to their initiative. If you fail, combat still starts, but the Ambushers have a \-10 to their Initiative and are not in Stealth. When the Hunted are Ambushing, it's their whole Squad who get these penalties or bonuses; when it's the Hunter, it's only the members sent in the cut-off.

### **Hunter Actions**

*Cut-off*

You send a member or two of your squad up and around, to try and position yourself for a nice Ambush. At the end of the Hunted's next turn, roll an Espionage vs. Survival. If you succeed, you are in position, and on your next 2 actions can use Ambush.

*Stop\!*

(Requires (1) Very Close)

If you are in the Very Close position, the Pursuit is over, the hunted is stopped, your side begins combat with \+5 on each player on your side's initiative.

*Give Up the Chase*

(-2 degrees)

You can choose to move two degrees away, if this would move you further than very far, you give up chasing. Just in case they wanted to turn back around on you at one point. If you do this three times but somehow don't leave pursuit they can choose to start a new pursuit, with you as the Hunted, starting from the distance you left off.

### **Hunted Actions**

*Traps*

(-10% Squad Speed)

Put down some traps\! You lose 10% Squad Speed to set up traps. At the end of the Hunter's next turn, roll 1d4, as well as an Espionage vs. Survival. The 1d4 determines the direction the traps strike from (1= Front, 2= Sides, 3=Back, 4=Center) If the Hunters fail their Survival, their squad is moved one degree away. They also each take (Espionage Ranks/5)d10 damage, with no damage bonus.

*Escape\!*

(Requires (5) Very Far)

If you are in the Very Far position, the Pursuit is over, you have gotten away\! It will take them a minimum of one hour to pick up a reliable set of tracks.

*Sacrifice\!\!\!*

(Special)

One of your members breaks off from your formation and leads the enemy team away. They automatically get one degree further away. The member who broke off now counts as a seperate squad and their tactic is set to stealth. There are three things the Hunter can choose on their next turn: To continue to pursue the main group, to pursue this 'new group' or to let one of their members leave their group to 1 vs 1 the guy.

# **Conditions and Status**

## **Conditions**

Conditions cover the overall health, well-being, and, well, condition, of your character. This lists the conditions, what they do, and where to find more information about them. For how to remove unwanted conditions, see the 'Recovery' section of this chapter.

### **Wounded**

Trained ninja can survive things that would kill or maim lesser humans, but sometimes a single blow will be so powerful that even their chakra-empowered, well-conditioned bodies cannot simply shrug it off. These are referred to as Wounds, and are explained in detail in the 'Wounds' section of this chapter. The effects, and healing requirements, for each type of wound can be found there.

### **Fatigued**

This is the result of (over)exerting oneself in battle. Rules for Fatigue, including how it's gained and the effects it has, are found in the 'Fatigue' section.

### **Incapacitated**

When your HP reaches 0, you are incapacitated. You're not necessarily unconscious, and you can still talk, but you're helpless, completely unable to take any kind of action or effectively defend yourself. An enemy who wants to can knock you unconscious with a single blow, or deliver a coup de grace (a Speed 10 attack that cannot be lowered by any means) to render you dead.

### **Unconscious**

One step up from incapacitated, this can result from being deliberately knocked out, or from severe Fatigue. When unconscious you are subject to all rules for being incapacitated, but cannot even talk or perceive your environment.

### **Dead**

Dying isn't as easy for ninja as normal people. There are two main ways you can die. The first is simple, overwhelming damage: If you are reduced to \-100% HP, you die. The second is a coup de grace, a blow specifically designed to be lethal.  
You may deliver a Coup de Grace only against an Incapacitated or Unconscious opponent. A Coup de Grace is a Speed 10, Delay 5 melee-ranged action.

## **Status Effects**

Status effects are things that will come and go throughout the course of battle. They come in many forms, and from many different sources.  
Some status effects may occur automatically; most of the time. Others, however, allow you a roll to avoid them.

Typically, this will be called a "status roll", or a "(specific status, such as burn) roll". Saying that the victim gets a Resistance roll against the effect is equivalent to saying that it has a status roll.

These rolls are either Chakra Control (for ninjutsu), Athletics (for taijutsu--but this is uncommon, as those effects are usually automatic), or Toxicology (for poisons). If anything else, that will be noted.

As implied above, the defender makes a Resistance skill check; if they equal or exceed the status roll, they avoid its effects. If not, they suffer them in full. Do keep in mind, if a technique or effect doesn't say it allows a roll, that probably means any special effects it has occur automatically.

Many of these status effects will be found on damaging attacks--for example, a sword slash that also causes its victim to start bleeding profusely. If the damage of such an attack is reduced to 0, none of its status effects will take place--with a few exceptions. Specifically, Immobilize and Paralysis will apply even if the attack causing them doesn't deal damage.

Poison sometimes has special rules in this regard, but they can be found in the appropriate section of the Equipment chapter.

### **Bleed**

Profuse bleeding from an injury. Among other things, this can ruin your clothes; bloodstains absolutely refuse to come out of most fabrics.

While bleeding, you lose Vitality (or HP) equal to double the severity of the Bleed status every 5 IC. You also have a penalty to your Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to half its severity, rounded down. Every 20 IC, you take an additional 1 damage for every 100 vitality the target is missing and then reduce the severity of the status by RES/40, minimum of 1.

Bleeds from the same source do not stack; the higher one overwrites the lower. Bleeds from different sources, however, all do their damage separately, though you still use only the highest Bleed to determine your Chakra Exhaustion penalty from the status.

### **Burns**

Generally resulting from exposure to fire or intense heat, such as some katon jutsu, being burnt makes it harder to fight effectively. Your Stamina rolls suffer a penalty equal to the Severity of the Burns on you.

You can suffer from multiple burn effects at the same time, though only the strongest penalty is actually applied. Any effects which reduce Stamina penalties reduce the severity of all your burns by the same amount. Accordingly, when you move to the next Fatigue category you are cleared of all burn effects.

### **Ignite**

You are on fire. Literally, you are burning. This is probably one of the most excruciatingly painful experiences of your life.

Ignite's effects are somewhat complicated. Like most statuses, it has a severity. You suffer a \-severity/2 penalty to your Stealth checks, and every 5 IC you take damage equal to its severity, plus its severity in percent of your current Vitality.

Thus, an Ignite 10 would give you \-5 to your Stealth and would deal 10 damage, plus 10% of your current Vitality. Each time it does damage, you subtract (RES/20) from its severity.

If you have no Vitality remaining, it instead does damage equal to its severity in percent of your maximum HP. The above Ignite 10 effect would deal 10% of your maximum HP in damage.

If someone ignites you again while you are already on fire (seriously, what kind of people are you fighting?), the more severe effect replaces the less severe one.

### **Immobility**

Immobilization effects are ones such as being stuck in mud or partially bound with ropes. An immobilization penalty reduces your defensive rolls by its value, and your Accuracy by half (rounded down) of its value; additionally, each point of immobilization penalty reduces your AGI for the purposes of movement by 10%. Immobilization 10 is "completely immobilized"; you cannot move at all, being rooted to your location (you could still attack and even attempt to dodge, just at a severe penalty). No matter how high your an immobilization penalty gets, its actual applied penalty can never go beyond \-10. Multiple immobilization penalties do not stack; if you're suffering from a \-8 and a \-4, you ignore the \-4 until the \-8 goes away.

### **Paralysis**

Paralysis differs from immobilization in that paralysis is an internal or mental effect which impedes your ability to move, whereas immobilization is generally used for effects which somehow physically restrain you.

When paralyzed, the Base Speed of all your Non-Interrupts Actions is increased by the Paralysis Severity, to a maximum of double their original Speed. At the same time, when determining damage from your attacks treat their Final Speed as if it was (Paralysis severity) lower. For Interrupts, Paralysis increases their Base Speed by half of the Paralysis Severity, rounded down.

For example, at Paralysis 3 your Basic Unarmed Attack would be Speed 11; you could reduce it to a minimum of Speed (11/2 \= 5.5) 6 with AP, and then it would multiply your damage bonus by (6 \- 3\) 3\. That same Paralysis would change your dodge to a Speed 3 Interrupt (meaning that some extremely quick, previously-avoidable attacks might become undodgeable).

Paralysis Effects do not combine. If you are afflicted with two Paralysis Effects at once, the more potent one overwrites the less severe one. If they both have the same Severity, the one with the longer Duration overwrites the other.

### **Poison**

When affected by a poison, you make a Resistance roll against some roll of the opponent's. Success means that you shrug off the effects of the poison. Failure means that you have been poisoned.

Actual poisons may carry any number of effects, but the most prominent is poison damage. For every IC that passes, you take damage equal to the poison's severity (also referred to as its rating), for the full duration of the poison. For example, you're affected by a Poison 5 with a duration of 12\. You take 5 damage per IC, each IC, until 12 counts after when you were first affected, for a total of 60 damage.

You may be affected simultaneously by multiple poisons. However, a single source (a specific jutsu or type of venom) may only affect you once; another application of it while under its effects simply renews the duration.

### **Sleep**

People sleep, generally because it's a necessary bodily function, but sometimes because they've been influenced by mind-affecting genjutsu. In reality, sleeping people are pretty much helpless. However, ninja develop a sixth sense that warns them of impending danger and functions even when not awake.

If someone tries to attack or sneak up on you while asleep you automatically wake up and can still roll initiative and/or defend yourself, though do so at a \-5 penalty until your second action after waking up.

### **Stun**

Actions which stun you delay your actions by the magnitude of the stun. For example, if your next action is on IC 14, and you are affected by a Stun 5 effect, your next action would be on IC 19\.

Multiple stuns do not stack, but a newer one of higher magnitude will overwrite the older. Thus, using the above example, if you were hit by a Stun 7, your next action would be on IC (14+7) 21; if you were then hit by a Stun 3, there would be no change.

If an effect says that it increases stun, it means that it increase the stun status that the jutsu, weapon or attack would inflict, not that it modifies stuns that a person is suffering from.

If an effect says that it extends an existing stun, it means that if a character has a stun effect, that effect is lengthened (and the character is stunned for longer).

Stun ends when get your next action; if the Stun is removed by some means prior to your next action, the effect the Stun has on your IC is removed, though this cannot bring your next action back to earlier than the  current IC.

### **Suffocation**
Someone or something is hindering your ability to breathe. Suffocation penalties stack, from different sources or multiple ones. Your suffocation penalty is applied to any Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls you make, and every time its value increases you have to make a Stamina roll with a TN equal to 10 /+ 2 /* Suffocation Level. Unlike normal Fatigue-related penalties, suffocation is not reset to 0 when your Fatigue advances. When you stop being suffocated, your suffocation penalty is reduced by 1 every 10 initiative counts.

### **Visibility**

These are penalties which reduce a person's ability to see clearly, impairing the use of their most valuable sense in combat. Visibility penalties do not stack; if you have a \-6 and a \-2, you ignore the \-2 until the \-6 is gone. The maximum visibility penalty you can suffer from (after any increases and reductions) is \-10.

Total blindness is a \-10 visibility penalty; one eye closed (or removed\!) is \-3. A visibility penalty reduces your Accuracy and Awareness by its value, and your defensive rolls by half (rounded down) of its value; even without their sight, a ninja's sixth sense often alerts them to danger and allows them to respond.

Many visibility penalties affect areas: clouds of smoke or mist and the like. In this case, you suffer the penalty when inside it, or when trying to attack or watch (but not defend against) someone inside it.

If it ever becomes relevant, closing or opening your eyes is a Speed 0 action--but not an Interrupt.

### **Buried**

Buried Status applies an Immobilization and Visibility penalty equal to its rating. You can be buried up to a rating of ten. At Buried one through five you can attack and be targeted. Higher than this you can not Attack or be targeted. Additionally unless you used a jutsu that says otherwise, you take your Buried*20 as Damage and Suffocation 2 every 10 IC once you have a Buried Status of Severity 5 or higher.

Any attack against a target with a different buried status is treated as having a layer of armor (occuring before all other damage calculations including partial attack) with a durability equal to half your chakra and absorption 10% per difference in buried status. So if you had a buried 5 and they had no buried status the ground would provide absorption 50\% with a durability of 2.5 times your CHA. Damage is transferred if you change elevation adjusting the durability accordingly and is only reset after moving at least 10 Yards. The Damage of Raiton Attacks is doubled before all calculations when targeting you in this manner and the Damage of Suiton is halved.

## **Other Effects**

### **Ignore Armor**

Some Weapons and Jutsus have this ability, or have ways to gain this ability. What 'Ignore Armor' does, is it allows any weapon, or effect with it, to bypass any and all positive effects of an Armor. This includes any Absorption, Wound negation, or special ability the armor has. Basically you are treated as having no armor on when hit by this effect\!

### **Area of Effect**

Certain things apply not to an individual, but to all things within a given area--their "area of effect", or AoE. These include things like explosions and smoke bombs The simpler type of AoEs are ones which are not directly offensive, such as a smoke bomb or a jutsu that creates a thick cloud of mist. These apply certain effects so long as you're in them, and can only be avoided by moving out.

Others, however, are attacks: they cause damage to everyone within an area. Depending on that area, it may not even be possible to avoid one effectively.  
When being subjected to an AoE attack, the first thing to determine is if you can dodge it effectively. To do this, take the attack's Speed, and determine how far you could move (see 'Actions') in that time. If that distance is greater than the effect's radius, then congratulations, you can dodge normally.  
If not, you have a \-2 penalty to Dodge per yard you're short by.

As AoEs are not, strictly speaking, targeting you, they have special stipulations. AoE attacks can still be parried, however, parrying an AoE attack only protects the person parrying against the attack unless stated otherwise. All other potential targets must still defend from the AoE themselves.

### **Knockback**

Certain jutsu have an effect referred to as "knockback", which does about what it sounds like: pushes you away from its user or point of origin. Knockback is measured in yards; a 10 yard knockback means that, if you are hit, you will be moved 10 yards away from wherever the jutsu originated from.  
Some may have more complex rules, such as pushing you to the edge of their area of effect.

When a technique knocks you back a certain number of yards, if partial defense applies then you will also reduce the knockback by that amount.  
The exception is area-of-effect knock backs centered on an individual (such as a Hyuuga's Kaiten and the A-rank jutsu Eye of the Storm): partial defense does not reduce the knockback from these, as they essentially "push" everything away from them equally.

### **Clones and Conditions**

Any clones you summon are subject to the same statuses and conditions you are suffering from at the time you summon them. This includes wounds or any status effect. Note: It may be a bad idea to make clones while on fire.

# **Weather Conditions**

## **Basic Weather**

There are a variety of conditions that happen in the world and many of them can interfere with or change what you're doing.

If you are safely in the confines of your village, you do not have to use weather (Though you can), but outside in a scene you must refer to the bottom of this section.

### **Fog**

Everybody in the field receives a \-4 Visibility penalty. And any Action (Awareness rolls, ranged attacks, etc) performed beyond 15 Yards from the individual, treats the Visibility penalty as if it was doubled.

### **Heavy Rain**

Everybody in the field receives a \-2 Visibility and Immobilization penalty, and \-5 to Survival when Tracking. Every 5 ICs during combat, 2 Gallons of Water are added onto the battlefield.

### **Snow**

Everybody in the field receives a \-3 to All Skills. And every time somebody's Chakra penalty increases, it increases by one more. Every 10 ICs during combat, 3 Gallons of Water are frozen into Ice.

### **Extreme Heat**

Everybody in the field receives a stacking Burn 2 every 15 ICs (Or 1 hour outside of combat). Any Suiton technique used requires double the Gallon investment for the same benefit. Every time somebody's Stamina penalty increases, it increases by one more.

### **High Winds**

Everybody in the field receives a \-4 Immobilization penalty. The Speed of all Fuuton Techniques (And Advanced Elements based on Fuuton) is increased by 3 for purposes of damage only.

### **High Air Pressure**

Everybody in the field has difficulty taking in breaths as the air is significantly heavier than normal. They must make a Stamina check every 20 IC (or 30 minutes out of combat) with a TN of 5+5\*Your current Fatigue level. This CANNOT be combined with Low Air Pressure. Oxygen Masks nullify the need to make this roll. The Speed of all Fuuton Techniques (And Advanced Elements based on Fuuton) is increased by 3 for the purposes of moving IC only.

### **Low Air Pressure**

Everybody in the field runs the risk of getting lightheaded as the air is significantly thinner than normal. Make a Resistance check every 20 IC (or 30 minutes out of combat), TN 10, increased by 5 every time they succeed, to a maximum of 50, or you suffer from a Minor Blunt Head wound . Rest actions can reduce the current TN by 5, to a minimum of 5\. This CANNOT be combined with High Air Pressure. Oxygen Masks nullify the need to make this roll. All Fuuton Techniques (And Advanced Elements based on Fuuton) deal \-20% damage for the purposes of Wounding.

# **Fatigue**

## **Stamina**

People get tired; it just happens, even to supernaturallyempowered ninja. To represent this, certain attacks have a stamina cost, listed in a format such as "Stamina: 10."

Whenever you use a move with a listed Stamina cost, you make a stamina roll: 1d20+RES/10. Regardless of the result, your attack is resolved normally. However, if you got less than the TN for your roll (that is, the move's Stamina rating) your Fatigue is raised by one category.

Realistically, continued exertion even at the same level will tire people out. Every time you make a stamina roll, you incur a penalty equal to (the Stamina cost)/5, rounded down, on all future Stamina rolls you make.

This penalty is reset to 0 every time you advance a Fatigue category, and at the end of battle. It can also be reduced by spending your time Resting in combat.

## **Chakra Exhaustion**

The counterpart to stamina. Shinobi have the ability to use all manner of fantastic abilities by drawing on the chakra within themselves and manipulating the environment. While very potent, this energy comes from their body, and it's easy for a shinobi, especially an inexperienced one, to overtax themselves.

Ninjutsu and genjutsu moves have a chakra cost, listed in a form such as "Chakra: 10." When you use these moves, you make a roll against Chakra Exhaustion; to pass, you must get equal to or greater than the technique's cost on a roll of 1d20+CHA/10. If you fail, your Fatigue is raised one category. Whether you pass or fail, your jutsu works normally.

The more chakra a shinobi spends, the more strain they put on their body. Whenever you make a Chakra Exhaustion roll, you incur a penalty equal to (the technique's Chakra cost)/5, rounded down, on all future Chakra Exhaustion rolls you make.

This penalty is reset to 0 every time your Fatigue category increases, and at the end of battle.

## **Techniques with both**

If you have a technique with both a Stamina and a Chakra cost you choose which one you roll first and apply the results. Then you roll the other one.

This means that if you fail your first roll, you increase your fatigue level by the appopriate amount and make any changes that apply on fatigue (such as removing burns). You then make the second roll as if the first has fully resolved, including any bonuses from the new fatigue level. If the second roll fails as well, you advance fatigue as you normally would. Note that fatigue penalties clear when you advance a fatigue level, which means that if you advance fatigue on the first roll, but not on the second, the penalties from the second are still added as normal.

## **Fatigue**

Fatigue represents the effects of weariness on your body. Shinobi can push themselves well beyond normal human capabilities, often displaying determination that exceeds their body's limits.

You begin a battle at Fatigue 0\. Whenever you fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, your Fatigue increments up one category, and your penalties to both those rolls reset to 0\.  
For every 15 points you fail a roll by, you automatically advance an additional Fatigue category; thus, rolling a 12 on a Stamina 45 technique would cause you to advance 1+(45- 12)/15 \= 3 Fatigue categories.

For each level of Fatigue, you apply the following effects: \-1 to your Accuracy, offensive rolls, and skill rolls \-2 to your defensive rolls \+5 to your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls

Fatigue only goes up to 5\. If you fail a Chakra Exhaustion or Stamina roll when at Fatigue 5, you complete your action and then fall unconscious, your body pushed beyond its limits.

One exception to that last paragraph, though. If you fail a technique badly enough that you would advance a Fatigue level beyond unconsciousness, the technique you were using fails to activate. Thus, say you're at Fatigue 4, and you fail a technique by 32 points. Failing it advances you to Fatigue 5; the first 15 points you fail it by advances you a second Fatigue category, placing you unconscious; however, you failed by another 15 points, and so not only are you unconscious, but your technique also fails to activate.

## **Example**

Naruto and Sasuke are fighting over who shall be Sakura's boyfriend.

Sasuke starts accosting his nemesis with multiple Shishio Rendan attacks, a Stamina 15 technique. The first, he rolls a plain 1d20+7, with a total of 16, narrowly avoiding failure. Still, he's angry, and he keeps going. The next roll is 1d20+7- 3; and, the next, 1d20+7-6. Both times he passes.

Not wanting to exhaust himself too quickly, Sasuke switches to his ninjutsu, tossing off a Grand Fireball, a ninjutsu with a Chakra cost of 16\. He rolls his 1d20+6, and passes the roll. He follows that with a Housenka (Chakra cost 14), rolls 1d20+6-3 for Chakra Exhaustion, and again passes his check.

At this point, Sasuke's next Stamina check will have a \-9 penalty, and his next Chakra Exhaustion roll will have a \-5 penalty.

Deciding that he'll probably fail his next roll regardless, he attacks with an impressive Chidori: the move has a Chakra Cost of 25, meaning there's no way he can pass its Chakra Exhaustion check. As expected, Sasuke fails, and advances to Fatigue 1\.

At this point, his Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls both have their penalty reset to 0, and since he's Fatigued, those rolls also have a \+5 bonus. He considers following immediately with another Chidori (he'd have a small chance of avoiding failure; a roll of 14 or better, 14+6+5=25, would be sufficient), but instead decides to pace himself.

# **Recovery**

## **Hit Points and Vitality**

Lost Vitality recovers fairly quickly; ninja don't get too far through their training without being able to get back on their feet. You recover 10% of your maximum Vitality every 10 minutes OOC.

Lost Hit Points are harder to deal with. By the time you're taking HP damage, your body's already reached its limit as far as soaking damage goes. You recover 10% of your max HP every 1 hour OOC.

## **Fatigue**

Fatigue is more than just being a little winded; it's exhaustion and bone-deep weariness. Ninja are just much better able to deal with such things than normal people. Every hour that passes OOC, your Fatigue is lowered by one level.

## **Willpower**

You begin every (OOC) day with your full amount of Willpower. With the exception of some rare effects, you can't get Willpower back any faster than that.

## **Wounds**

Wounds are particularly grievous injuries, ones powerful enough to have effects beyond just beating you that much closer to unconsciousness. Despite their differences in affects all wounds heal at the same rate according to their type.

Minor wounds all heal at the end of the spar they were made in.  
Major wounds require 6 weeks to heal or 4 while in the hospital.  
Severe wounds require 12 weeks to heal or 8 while in the hospital.  
Critical wounds require 25 weeks to heal or 16 while in the hospital.

## **Medical Attention**

Medical attention requires a ninja (can be a player or npc) to be actively assisting with your recovery like through the Doctor's downtime action. Simply checking yourself into the hospital won’t cut it. While receiving medical attention your wounds heal at twice the normal rate for the duration. (If they provide medical attention for one cycle but not for the second you only receive the increased healing speed for that first cycle).

### **Rest**

Your body can't heal when you're putting too much stress on it. It's why doctors recommend bed rest (and lots of fluids, and "grape" flavored medicine that tastes just horrid, and nothing like grapes).

'Rest' for a ninja, however, does not entail laying in bed for the afternoon. Taking damage, or failing a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, interrupts your healing; this applies to Vitality, HP, and Stamina. So, if you had been recovering from 0 Vitality, Fatigue 3, and full HP for an hour and fifteen minutes, then did something to exert yourself and failed a Stamina roll, you'd have recovered 70% of your maximum Vitality (75 minutes, /10 \= 7\) and 1 Fatigue level, putting you at Fatigue 2--except you just failed that roll, so back to Fatigue 3 you go.

That doesn't apply to Wounds (unless specified otherwise) or Willpower. If your healing of a Wound is interrupted (usually by a method mentioned in that Wound's description), you still keep however many days of progress you've made towards recovering from it--you just don't get to count the current day (which as a reminder is every 6 hours)
