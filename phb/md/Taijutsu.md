Not much to say here. You hit people with your fists, feet, and in all manner of other creative ways. These techniques can stand on their own but contains integral pieces for Combo and Grapple jutsu.

## **Unarmed E-Rank**

### **Deashi Harai: Foot Sweep**

You cause an opponent to fall down by knocking their legs out from under them. Calling it a 'technique' is misleading, but there's more to unbalancing a ninja than just wanting to; it does take at least a little bit of training.

Stamina: 8  
Speed: 4  
Special: \+2 Accuracy
Special: Prone

Tags: 1 Leg

Effects:
If used while in a grapple it gains the following: Takedown, Control 5.

### **Feint**

A subtle trick that almost every ninja knows--and knows how to detect. Still, those that are particularly adept at it are often difficult to defend against properly.

Stamina: X \+ 2  
Speed: X \+ 2

Effect:
This is used alongside any other melee-range Unarmed or Combo Attack, and increases that action's Stamina and Speed by 2 each. Make an opposed Espionage roll; if you beat their result, you've tricked them with your feint. If successful, this triples the Speed of their defensive action for the purpose of determining when they'll act next.

This doesn't prevent it from being a valid Interrupt against your attack.

### **Headbutt**

You use your head to hit someone else's head. Really, honestly, it's a highly technical process. You just don't understand because you're not a ninja.

Stamina: 6
Damage: STR
Speed: 7
Accuracy: \-1
Special: Control 1

Tags: Attack, Melee, Blunt

Effect:  
This always deals a head wound and you must take the final wounding damage, if that would cause you a wound then you gain a head wound of that severity.

When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 1

## **Unarmed D-rank**

### **Teiryuu Dageki \- Halting Blow**

In one smooth motion, the user extends their arm and pushes aside an oncoming blow, steps inward and pulls back their forearm to slam their elbow into the opponent, turning their defense into their offense.

Stamina: 11
Damage: (STR /4)d4  
Speed: 5  
Special: Interrupt, Opener

Tags: 2 Arms

Effects:
Halting Blow is used as an unarmed parry, with a \+3 Accuracy bonus. If you successfully defend, Halting Blow immediately acts as an attack at no extra cost, using the results of your parry roll as its Accuracy and its speed.

Momentum: Parries performed while the Combo is not broken are Speed 1 and have a \+3 bonus to their Accuracy roll. This does not apply to any Jutsu.

### **Senpuu \- Whirlwind**

The user rotates while extending one leg, starting with a high roundhouse that's used partially as a feint. Whether it hits or misses, they continue to rotate into a second spin aimed at the lower part of the body.

Stamina: 15 
Damage: (STR /5)d8  
Speed: 12  
Area: 2
Special: Opener

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this deals 25\% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20%.

Momentum: Your combo jutsu hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, this deals 25\% damage per point you hit by, rather than 20\%.

### **Reppuu \- Gale**

With alarming quickness you drop low to the ground and perform a full 360-degree sweeping kick that knocks opponents off their feet when they attempt to close in for an attack of their own.

Stamina: 13
Damage: (STR /6)d10
Speed: 8
Special: Interrupt, Opener

Tags: 1 Leg

Effects: 
Gale may (but doesn’t require to) be used as an interrupt after you have successfully dodged an attack, targeting the attacker. If Gale is used after a dodge in this fashion, the dodge roll replaces Gale's accuracy.

Momentum: Dodging while the Combo is not Broken is a Speed 1 Interrupt.

### **Dainamikku Entorii \- Dynamic Entry**

This technique is nothing more than a jumpkick at an opponent from hiding. The hiding part became required because of genin's tendency to shout out things like "HIYAH\!" as they did it.

Stamina: 16
Damage: (STR /3)d6
Speed: 12
Special: Requires you be hidden from your target.

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
After the first time Dynamic Entry has been used in combat (by you, by someone else, it doesn't matter) it has a \-6 Accuracy for the rest of that battle.

### **Tokken \- Thrusting Shoulder**

By charging forward and turning at the last moment to bring a shoulder out front, the user slams into the enemy, knocking them back. It relies mostly on the weight of the user, with the expectation they'll be heavier than the person they're running into.

Stamina: 15
Damage: (RES /4)d8
Speed: 12

Tags: 1 Arm

Effects:
This knocks the victim back (your RES)/10 yards.

### **Flash Step**

Stamina: \+X/3  
Speed: \+ X/3  

Tags: Utility, Link

Effect:  
This is used alongside a melee Taijutsu attack, increasing your move with attack X yards to a maximum of the speed of the jutsu.

### **Irimiseme - Entering Attack**
Rather then a direct attack this jutsu involves stepping into close range with an opponent and deflecting a weapon or jutsu by targeting their wrist or elbow.

Stamina: 12
Speed: 4
Tags: Interrupt

Effects:
This may be used to parry any weapon attack or attack ninjutsu performed in melee range. The speed of this interrupt cannot be reduced below 2.

### **Throw**

You use leverage, brute force, or a combination of the two to physically throw an enemy, either by flipping them over you, hurling them into a nearby object, slamming them to the ground, or something similar.

Stamina: 14
Damage: (STR/3)d6
Speed: 8
Accuracy: \-2
Special: Stun 4

Tags: 2 Arms

Effect:
If used while in a grapple it gains the following: Takedown, Control 8

## **Unarmed C-rank**

### **Daisenpuu \- Great Whirlwind**

A more complex version of Senpuu which involves three kicks to the target's body going in the reverse order as before, starting low and going high to end with an axe kick to the opponent's head. The speed and constant rotation is strong enough to actually lift the practitioner into the air during execution.

Stamina: 22
Damage: (STR /5)d12
Speed: 14
Area: 3
Requires: Senpuu
Special: Opener

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
This attack hits all enemies in range. If partial defense applies, you deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20\%.

Momentum: Your Combo Jutsu have Area 3. Your Combo is not broken as long as at least one person you hit with this Jutsu is a target for the attack. If partial defense applies to your Combo Jutsu, you deal 1/3 damage per point you hit by, rather than 20\%.


### **Tsutenkyaku \- Painful Sky Leg**

After concentrating chakra in the user's legs, they leap high into the air and come down in a destructive axe kick, using gravity to enhance the momentum behind the blow while the user's chakra is used to enhance the destructive force of the blow.

Stamina: 28
Damage: (STR /20)d20
Area: 6
Speed: 16
Special: \-6 Accuracy

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects:
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack. Effects of partial hits for this jutsu are extended and deal 10\% per amount they succeed.  

For example on an accuracy 20 attack a defense of: 15-Full Hit, 16-90\%, 17-80\%, 18-70\%, 19-60\%, 20-50\%, 21-40\%, 22-30\%, 23-20\%, 24-10\%, 25-Fully Defended.  

### **Souji Reppuu \- Sweeping Gale**

By flipping forward into a crouch, the user builds momentum that's used to instantly land and begin spinning on one foot, extending the other leg out while using chakra to enhance its density, rotating repeatedly to strike the knees of the enemy, simultaneously evading and tripping them.

Stamina: 21
Damage: (STR /4)d8
Speed: 8
Special: Interrupt, Opener
Requires: Deashi Harai: Foot Sweep, Reppuu

Tags: 2 Leg

Effects:
This follows the rules for the D-rank Reppuu technique (including its Momentum). Should you hit, the opponent is knocked prone.


### **Uchikudakute no Jutsu \- Shattering Hand Technique**

Ninja can perform incredible feats of strength; after years of grueling training, some can literally reduce boulders to gravel for their bare fists. That's a handy trick to have, but most ninja aren't willing to go through the whole 'years of pain and hard work' part, so instead they invented a jutsu which accomplishes a similar effect: by channelling vibrating chakra through their hand at the moment of impact, most solid objects can be shattered with a single blow.

Stamina: 24
Damage: (STR /8)d20
Speed: 13
Delay: 5

Tags: Attack, Blunt, Melee, 2 Arms

Effects:  
Before wounds or damage are calculated, this completely destroys any armor protecting the location it hits.

Against objects this jutsu always does its max damage. If the object is not chakra enhanced nor made of chakra you double its speed for the purposes of dealing damage.

### **Bōshi Riken \- Spinning Backfist**

With a burst of chakra to one of the user's legs, they spin around and extend an arm to knock an opponent senseless with the back of their fist. It's a powerful blow as it uses the weight and momentum of the user's entire body, but has an inherent weakness of losing sight of the enemy while spinning.

Stamina: 26
Damage: (STR /4)d10
Accuracy: \-3
Speed: 10

Tags: 1 Arm

Effects:
This technique's damage is tripled when determining the severity of wounds it inflicts. 

### **Attsu Buchikomu \- Pain Driver**

A brutal technique, and completely inappropriate for training (because someone would have thought it was okay, if we didn't say that). The attacker finds a weak point on their opponent's body, the site of a previous injury, and strikes there to amplify the existing wound.

Stamina: 20
Damage: (STR /3)d4
Speed: 12

Effects: 2 Arms
This attack must be a called shot, and does not normally inflict wounds. Instead, if it targets a location with a Minor Blunt wound, that wound is removed and replaced with a Major Blunt wound on the same location. This only applies if the attack deals damage.

### **Maboroshi Tejun \- Phantom Step**

Despite the fancy name, it's a fairly simple 'technique'. With a momentary burst of energy (and probably adrenaline, considering the circumstances where it's likely to be used) the user does their best to get out of the way of an impending attack. The "phantom" came mostly from the way a shinobi using this can, to the untrained eye, seems to almost disappear. And because ninjas thought it sounded cool.

Stamina: 5 \* X  
Speed: \+X

Effects:
This is used alongside a dodge attempt, increasing its Speed by X and provides it with a \+X bonus. Your dodge's final speed cannot go lower than 2 \+ X.

If combined with the B-rank Leaping Shadow Evasion this technique increases LSE's Stamina cost to (20 \+ 4\*X), which replaces Phantom Step's normal Stamina cost.

### **Chouyaku Kage Kaihi no Jutsu \- Leaping Shadow Evasion Technique**

You leap away from an attack, getting yourself safely out of range. However, you don't pause to regain your orientation and settle into your new position, instead keeping ready to move again.

Stamina: 18
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: 4

Effects:
When you use Chouyaku Kage Kaihi, make a dodge roll. You may automatically attempt to dodge any incoming attacks, without having to take an action to do so, using Chouyaku Kage Kaihi's result as your effective dodge roll. This lasts until you take any action, including defensive interrupts.

### **Ryuorosu - Dragon Takedown**

Adapted--in purpose, method, and name--from a 'normal' style of martial arts, the Dragon Takedown is a more aggressive method of initiating a grapple, often throwing an opponent to the ground in the process.

Stamina: 23
Damage: (STR /3)d6
Speed: 18

Effects:
If you hit, you initiate a clinch with your opponent but you gain a \-5 to your control. Then you may immediately attempt a pin for no cost.

### **No Design, No Conception**

When words and actions are spontaneously the same. You move forwards at the exact same time as your opponent and in doing so throw off their rhythm. Of course, the spontaneous nature of this technique makes it impossible to have any rhythm of your own to attack with, but the practiced shinobi can take advantage of the situation to grab ahold of their opponent.

Stamina: 5 \+ ( 5 \* X )
Special: Interrupt
Speed: \+ X

Tags: 2 Arms

Effects:
X has a maximum of 5. This technique is used alongside any interrupt that requires a defensive roll against an opponent’s Accuracy whilst you are at range 0 with that opponent. You take a penalty of X to your roll, if you successfully defend, No Design, No Conception immediately acts as a Grab at no extra cost, using the results of your dodge roll for its Accuracy and Speed (minimum 3). You gain X Control in the subsequent clinch.

### **Suplex**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suplex Just... read that, okay? That's what you do to them.

Stamina: 13
Damage: (STR/4)d10
Speed: 15
Accuracy: \-3
Special: Control 5

Tags: Attack, Melee, Blunt

Effects:  
When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 3
 

## **Unarmed B-rank**

### **Kage Buyou \- Shadow of the Dancing Leaf**

The user lowers themself to get underneath their opponent, and then knocks them into the air with a violent rising kick, leaping after them immediately after it to position themselves in the target's shadow.

Stamina: 19
Damage: (STR/4)d10
Accuracy: \+2
Speed: 8
Special: Opener

Tags: 2 Arms

Effects: 
You knock your opponent into the air for 10 IC and they gain the prone condition.

Momentum: If used as the Opener of a Combo, All Combo Jutsus will gain the above effect.

### **Gouriki Senpuu \- Strong Whirlwind**

Taking the Whirlwind back to the basics, the shinobi no longer bothers with a series of strikes, and instead just focuses their ability into a single roundhouse with more speed and power than the previous versions.

Stamina: 36
Damage: (STR /3)d12
Speed: 16
Area: STR/30
Special: Opener
Requires: Daisenpuu

Tags: 2 Legs

Effects: 
This damages everyone in range. If partial defense applies, this technique does 50\% of its normal damage per point it hits by, rather than 20\%. Anyone hit is knocked back STR/20 Yards.

Momentum: You designate only one target hit by this attack as your Combo Target. All Combo Jutsu gain Knockback of (STR/20) Yards. You can move an additional (STR/20) Yards for free as part of your “Move with an Attack” Maneuver with Combo Jutsu.


### **Dai Dageki \- Heavy Blow**

One of the simplest hand to hand maneuvers at the highest of levels, this attack is straight and to the point. Sacrificing trickery or fancy techniques, you deliver a powerful blow with the full weight of your body behind it.

Stamina: 32
Damage: As Basic Attack
Speed: 8
Special: Finisher

Tags: 1 Arm

Effects:
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack.

### **Gawa-Ryuu \- River Style**

The ultimate recourse of taijutsu fighters who are frustrated with only being able to land glancing blows on their opponents, this technique sends a surge of chakra through the attacking limb. This results in a burst of speed and strength, and also a chakra 'shockwave' along the edge of the attack that carries almost as much force as the strike itself.

Chakra: 15 \+ X/2

Effects:
This is activated after you hit with an Unarmed or Combo taijutsu attack at melee range, but its damage is reduced by partial defense. X is that technique's Stamina cost, after all modifications.

When you activate River Style, your Accuracy with that attack is retroactively increased by 3, or the minimum value to do full damage (i.e. overcome partial defense), whichever is lower.

Your opponent may spend Willpower on their defense after you've declared activation of River Style. If you then spend Willpower on your Accuracy, River Style's effects last until your attack has been fully resolved.

### **Kurokumaken - Black Bear Strength**

A devastating move, developed by a shinobi who claimed he had gained inspiration for it by watching the fighting tactics of wild bears. The user wraps their arms around their opponent and squeezes with incredible strength. Users of this move have been known to crack arm bones and break ribs.

It was later pointed out that real bears do not actually hug people, to death or otherwise. The original inventor of the move refused to comment, and the name was in wide use by that point anyway.

Stamina: 33
Damage: (STR /3)d12
Speed: 18
Accuracy: \-5

Tags: Attack, Melee, Blunt

If this Technique deals a wound, then it applies 2 to the Arms instead of just a single Wound. When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 5, and the and the damage increases to d20s.

### **Tora Rakka - Tiger Drop**

You flip your opponent over you and hurl them to the ground (or otherwise maneuver them unpleasantly if you're both already on the ground) and slam an elbow, knee, or other body part into them, using gravity to assist your momentum. Nobody really knows what this has to do with tigers.

Stamina: 30
Damage: (STR /5)d12
Speed: 9
Accuracy: \-5
Special: Stun 10

Effects:  
Your damage bonus is doubled for this attack. If Tiger Drop inflicts a wound, it is dealt to the opponent's head. This technique leaves you and your opponent prone.

When used while in a grapple this jutsu gains: Pummel, Control 5, the grapple is ended, and the damage increases to d20s. 

## **Unarmed A-Rank**

### **Okasho \- Cherry Blossom Impact**

Taking chakra infused muscles to the next level, the user focuses a massive amount of chakra into their fist, foot, or even fingertip. Upon striking the chakra is released into their target causing a great deal of damage. Given that the damage is dependent on the amount of chakra channeled, a truly great shinobi can even use this technique with a single fingertip.

Stamina: 35  
Chakra: X  
Damage: Xd12  
Speed: 24  
Requires: Chakra Strengthening, Chakra Control 30

Effects:
Okasho's Speed is multiplied by (your physical damage bonus) \+ (your ninjutsu damage bonus/2), rather than just your physical damage bonus. You may give this technique an Area of (X/4), though doing so reduces its damage to (X)d6.

### **Benkei-do \- Way of Benkei**

A mixture of folk hero and mythical character, Benkei was a warrior monk known for his peerless skill in combat and unswerving loyalty to his master. One of the popular stories about his exploits involved Benkei guarding a bridge, holding back hundreds of warriors before finally succumbing to his wounds. This technique pays homage to his exploits, focusing all a shinobi's efforts on defense.

Stamina: 10  
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: \+0

Effects:
You may activate Way of Benkei alongside a normal defense. Until your next action, your defenses have a (+1+X) bonus, with X being the number of times you've attempted to defend yourself (successfully or otherwise) since activating Way of Benkei (including the defense it was activated with). You may choose not to use Way of Benkei on a given defense; doing so does not reset its X value or require it to be reactivated.

The only defenses which "count" for Way of Benkei are dodges and unarmed parries. You may use other defenses, but they do not receive its bonus or increase its X value. Way of Benkei ends when your take a non-Interrupt action, at which point you pay a secondary Stamina cost of 10+3\*X, to a maximum of 40\. You may declare Block, Total Defense, Guard, and similar effects without ending Way of Benkei.

### **Gouken \- Iron**

A generalized term for one school of thought for how to approach taijutsu, the idea behind 'Iron Fist' is to give every attack one's all, aiming to cause the maximum amount of damage in as few strikes as possible. This often involves thrusting punches and short-range kicks, and is undeniably effective. The downside, however, is that putting all one's force into a single blow results in telegraphing one's motions to an observant opponent, and can quickly tire the user.

Stamina: \+X\*2
Accuracy: \-X/4 (round up)
Speed: Special

Tags: Interrupt

Effects:
This supplements another Unarmed Jutsu, or Basic Taijutsu Attack. That Attack's base Speed (including for damage calculations) is increased by X, and your Physical Damage Bonus is also increased by X.

X has a maximum of STR/10.


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Combo**

## **Combo Tags**

Opener: If it hits, this jutsu begins a combo on the target (expanded on below). Note most Openers are located in the Unarmed section. It includes the Attack tag.  
Combo: The jutsu is treated as a combo jutsu (expanded on below). It includes the Attack tag. By default these jutsu are treated as links to a Basic Attack and modify those amounts (meaning you can choose how much Power Attack to use). For jutsu with this tag dD is the die size of your unarmed attack.  
Finisher X: This must be used at the end of a combo with a counter X or greater. It includes the Attack tag.  

## **Combos**

When you enter a Combo you begin tracking a Combo Counter (or CC) against that specific target starting at 0. Every time you hit that target with a jutsu that has the Combo tag, your CC increases by 1. Every Combo jutsu has a Cadence which has its effect multiplied by your CC and applied to the attack. For example a Combo Counter: +1dX Dice, -1 Speed would do nothing at CC 0, deal an extra dice of damage and reduce the speed by 1 at CC 1, and deal 3 extra dice of damage and reduce the speed by 3 at CC 3.

Every Opener has a “Momentum” section which is an effect that grants some sort of benefit to the user until the combo is ended. Momentum can only be applied to jutsu with the Combo tag (so no Finishers). If your CC would go below 0 your combo ends.

## **Switching Combos**

At any point during a Combo Sequence, you can opt to use a new Opener to change the momentum bonus of the combo. The new Opener will receive the momentum bonus of the previous Opener just as if it was a Combo Jutsu at 1 combo counter. This attack does not advance your combo counter.

## **Breaking a Combo Sequence**
When a combo is broken, your Combo Counter is immediately set back to 0, you may not continue using combo moves, and all accrued combo counter bonuses are lost. Combo breaking occurs if any of the following things happen:

You make any action without the Combo Tag  
You use any interrupt requiring seals.  
You execute a Finisher.  
You attack a new Target.  
You are Stunned.  
Hitting a clone of your intended target does not break your combo, but it does not increase your combo counter.

### **Rendan \- Combo**

Not so much a proper technique as a catch-all term for any series of attacks made in rapid succession, without breaking one’s flow or allowing an opponent time to retreat.

Combo Counter: \+2dD damage, \-1 Speed, \+1 Stamina

Tags: Combo

### **Yaburi Yashi \- Smashing Palm**

Speed: \-2  
Combo Counter: \-1 to parry this jutsu, \+1 Stamina

Tags: Combo

Speed: 12  
Special: Finisher  
Combo Bonus: \+1dD, \+2 Stun, \+1 Stamina

Speed: 15  
Special: Stun 12, Finisher  
Requires: Target to be Prone.

Tags: Finisher 3

### **Gekido Denka \- Furious Charge**

The basis of combos in battle is maintaining one’s momentum, striking one blow before the opponent’s fully recovered from the one before it. In many cases, all one needs is a few seconds to get away from their opponent and catch their breath to escape an otherwise merciless beating. You, however, just love to beat people mercilessly. Though it’s taxing, you can keep your adrenaline up, and keep your blows coming rapidly and rhythmically, even after being forced to chase after your victims.

Stamina: 15  
Upkeep: 2   
Speed: 6  
Tags: Utility, Interrupt

Accuracy: \-2  
Speed: 8  
Combo Counter: Blocking/DR is 5\% less effective, \+15 damage

Tags: Combo

### **Shishi Danmaku \- Lion Barrage**

A popular way to end the similarly-named combo-assault, the Lion Barrage was is often taught to students along with Lion Combo itself. Advanced taijutsu users, however, have been known to appreciate the flexibility and fluidity that comes from separating the techniques. The Lion Barrage is simply a series of fast, strong fist and knee strikes.

Stamina: 22  
Damage: \+ 6dD  
Speed: 14  
Accuracy: \+4  
Combos Bonus: +2dD  

Tags: Finisher 3

Stamina: \+7  
Speed: \+4  
Combo Bonus: Ignore 10% of DR, Enemy gains -2 DR for the rest of the fight

Tags: Finisher 5, Link

Exploiting a momentary break in your opponent’s attacks, you turn the tables on them\! It’s very exciting, and stuff.

Stamina: 20  
Speed: 8  
Requires: A Target with an active Combo Counter.

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
You and your opponent both make Parry rolls. If your result is higher, you immediately break their Combo and can execute any Opener you know as an Interrupt, with a starting Combo Counter equal to whatever your opponent’s was when you used this technique. If you fail, your opponent may immediately use any Combo Jutsu they know against you as an Interrupt.

## **Combo B-Rank**

### **Hasu Rendan \- Lotus Combo**

The user of this technique launches into a sequence of strikes designed to alternately wind, disorient, and daze their opponent, combining those effects to prevent their adversary from fighting back effectively for as long as possible.

Speed: 4  
Combo Bonus: \+1dD damage, \+2 Stamina, \+2 Speed

Tags: Combo, Interrupt

Effects:  
This may be used as an interrupt after missing a combo jutsu. This jutsu becomes an attack gaining that attack’s Combo Bonus (On a hit it only increases your CC by 1).

### **Hokuto no Ken \- Fist of the North Star**

Delivering a precise, rapid, and powerful series of blows to vital points on an opponent’s body, this causes their blood vessels to spontaneously rupture, resulting in both internal hemorrhaging and dramatic external bleeding, sometimes even resulting in a brief spray of blood immediately after its use.

Stamina: 28  
Damage: \+ 9dD  
Speed: 18  
Accuracy: \+2  
Combo Bonus: \+1dD, \+3 Bleed  

Tags: Finisher

Even if Hokuto no Ken is parried or blocked, it still inflicts its full Bleed.

### **Shougekishou \- Upwards Attacking Palm**

A difficult attack to connect with, the shinobi brings their palm from waist height and strikes upwards to full extension. This makes it exceptionally difficult to connect with, though if the user does hit they'll send their opponent flying away.

Stamina: 30

Special: Finisher 0  
Combo Bonus: \+2 Stun, \+3 Knockback

If you are in a clinch, the Accuracy penalty is negated. The clinch is ended if this technique hits. After being hit the opponent is knocked back (STR/20) yards and left prone.

If no enemy has acted since you executed this Finisher you may use any Finisher of Rank C against the target. This Finisher is treated as if you had 1 less CC as before using Upwards Attacking Palm.

### **Aragami no Jutsu \- God of Battle Technique**

Rather than waiting for your opponents to give you openings and then capitalizing upon them, you make openings. When that doesn’t work, you break through your opponent’s defenses anyway, attacking even when it seems fruitless, until finally something gives.

Stamina: 25  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
After your first attack in a combo you increase your CC by \+1 every time you hit with a Combo jutsu, to a maximum of 6. This does not stack with the bonus from Combo Master.

### **Mouretsu Tora no Jutsu \- Furious Tiger Technique**

You break off your combo with an abrupt transition back into more traditional taijutsu techniques, taking advantage of the momentum and rhythm you’ve built up to deliver one devastating blow.

Stamina: \+3  
Combo Bonus: \+1/2 Accuracy (rounded up), \+\5% damage, \+2 Stamina  
Tags: Finisher 0, Link

Tags: Combo  


### **Akuma no Isoi \- Devil’s Rush**

A technique that requires extreme speed and toughness, and a considerable disregard for one’s own health. Most shinobi learn first-hand in the academy what ‘chakra burns’ are: burns, typically found on the hands (where chakra is typically focused), caused by poorly forcing too much of one’s chakra through their body’s “chakra pores”. This technique takes a common mistake among academy students and weaponizes it, forcibly overwhelming one’s own chakra circulatory system in the arms and hands, superheating their body. That, combined with the high-speed blows delivered by this technique, results in what appear to be literally flaming punches. This can actually be delivered in kicks as well, and the general consensus is that a ‘burning’ leg is more visually impressive. Most ninja, however, prefer punches, because they hate fun.

Stamina: \+6  
Damage: \+ 6d6!>6  
Speed: \-2  
Combo Counter: \+2d6!>o damage, \+2 Ignite  

Tags: Finisher 1, Link

Effects:  
This is added on to a Basic Attack. If you hit, your target rolls Resistance against your Athletics. On a success, the severity of the Ignite is halved. You suffer Burns with a severity equal to the Ignite you inflict.

### **Taiyou Douyou no Jutsu \- Solar Agitation Technique**

For once, the name actually has a basis in reality\! This technique is a single, devastating blow to the opponent’s solar plexus, knocking the wind from their lungs and temporarily debilitating them in the aftermath.

Stamina: 30  
Damage: (STR/5)d20  
Speed: 18  
Accuracy: \+2  
Combo Bonus: \+3 Stun, \+1 to target’s Chakra penalty, \+1d20 damage, \+2 Stamina  

Tags: Finisher 5

Effects:  
This has an additional feature if used against an opponent who was performing handseals. If the total Stun from Solar Agitation is greater than the Speed of their Perform Handseals action, the victim automatically Aborts their Perform Handseals action (as if they had failed the Chakra Control roll against the attack’s damage dealt), and must make a Chakra Exhaustion roll against the technique aborted.

### **Senkagami no Jutsu \- God of War Technique**

The greatest of hand-to-hand combatants are able to dispatch enemies one after another in the midst of battle, their momentum never lagging, their blows not showing the slightest hint of hesitation. If you’ve mastered this technique, you are officially one of them\! Congratulations\!

Stamina: 10 \+ 5\*X  
Upkeep: X\*2  
Speed: \+3  

Tags: Utility, Interrupt

Effects:  
This is used in response to missing a Finisher with X being your CC prior to using that attack.. Your combo is not broken, instead your Combo Counter is reduced by 1. When your combo is broken, Senkagami’s Upkeep ends; similarly, if you end Senkagami’s Upkeep, your combo ends automatically.

## **Grappling Basics (read this section)**

Grappling comes with a lot of rules detailed below but it can be simplified depending on your usage, separating grapple users and poor ninja with the misfortune of fighting one. Below will be rough summaries for each.

If you just want to know how to escape from the 7ft giant choking you out then all you need to understand is escape methods and the difference between clinch and pin. Your primary methods of getting out are Break Clinch and Escape Pin. By using them multiple times you keep increasing your bonus until you are finally able to break out. If you are pinned you want to use Escape Pin and if you are in a clinch you want to use Break Clinch. Escape Grapple provides an alternative method for getting out but has higher risk for a higher reward.

As a grappler your goal is to gain as much control as you can while dropping your opponents. Step 1) Setup a clinch, Step 2) Use a takedown to pin them, Step 3) Make them suffer. Other grapple jutsu are designed to reduce your opponent's control to make it harder to escape. Once you have them in a pin you can either pummel them with taijutsu attacks or lock them in a hold.  

Certain situations within a grapple may call for a 'grapple roll'. When this happens, the player that triggered the Check rolls Grapple Offense and the other rolls Defense.

[M10] Grapple Off: 10 \+ Control \+ STR/10 \+ Any relevant bonuses/penalties
[M11] Grapple Def: 1d20 \+ Control \+ STR/10 \+ AGI/20 \+ Any relevant bonuses/penalties

While in a grapple all participants gain access to the following actions:

Reposition (Stamina 5 \+ X\*2, Speed 2 \+ X) You may spend X AP to increase your control by that amount. X has a maximum of your ranks in either the pressure or Escape Artist abilities.

Break Clinch (Stamina 5 \+ X/2, Speed 5 \+ X/2, Delay X, Control 0) Must be used in a clinch. You make a Grapple Defense roll versus your opponent’s Offense. If you succeed, the grapple ends immediately. You gain a \+X bonus to the roll. The maximum of X starts at 1 and increases by 1 for every 5 IC the current grapple has lasted.

Escape Pin (Stamina 7 \+ X/2, Speed 6, Delay 10, Control 0) You make a Grapple Defense roll versus your opponent’s Offense. If you succeed, the grapple ends immediately. You gain a \+X bonus to the roll. The maximum of X starts at 1 and increases by 1 for every 5 IC the current grapple has lasted.

## **Grapple-Related Tags (also this)**

Trapping X: Requires you to be in a clinch, make a grapple roll and on a success reduce the target’s control by X on top of any additional effects provided by the technique.

Takedown: Requires you to be in a clinch, make a grapple roll and on a success you and your target are transferred to a pin on top of any additional effects provided by the technique.

Ground Fighting X: Requires you to be in a pin, make a grapple roll and on a success reduce the target’s control by X on top of any additional effects provided by the technique.

Submission: Requires you to be in a pin, make a grapple roll and on a success your target receives all effects of the jutsu. When your submission is ended your IC is increased by 5.

Pummel: While in a grapple this modifies an attack turning it into a grapple jutsu. You may choose to attack as normal or use your grapple offense vs your opponents grapple defense. If the attack has an accuracy penalty your grapple offense gains that penalty. The defender may forgo their grapple defense to take any viable defense that does not dodge or parry.

You may only use one trapping or ground fighting jutsu (successfully) per grapple resetting when it changes category (clinch to pin or vice versa). Regardless of type, all grapple jutsu require all 4 limbs to be free except for Escape Grapple.

## **Control**

Grappling is all about moving positions to force your opponent into a disadvantageous position. A grappler will use this to progress to stronger holds while their opponent may do everything they can to worm their way out. To determine starting control, make opposing grapple checks with the instigator rolling offense and the defender having the choice to roll offense or defense. The winner gains control equal to the amount they beat their opponents roll.

If the person with control gains more their amount is added to their total. If the person without control gains some, their opponent's control is reduced to that amount (potentially reducing it back to 0 where any more control would become their positive amount). Each participant has a max Control of 10 \+ half their ranks in Pressure (rounded up).

While in a clinch or grapple you are not restricted by what actions you can take. However, there are many ways for your control to be reduced whether by your actions or your opponents. Below is the list of the most common ways for control to be lost which occurs after the action takes place:

> Any action with a listed control reduces it by that much such as most grapple jutsu and grapple-related actions do. This occurs before the jutsu’s effects.

> Every other action (including interrupts reduces your control in the grapple by one-third its speed (rounded down)

> Receiving damage greater than your RES / 4 reduces your control by 1 

> Receiving damage greater than your RES / 4 reduces your control by 1

> Each unique Status Condition reduces your grapple offense and defense by their severity/4 (minimum of 1)

## **Clinch**

You are clinching and clinched by your opponent. In a clinch, the following effects apply to all participants:

> Any movement (such as running, Shushin, knockback) is halved, and moves the other person along with them.

> Any interrupt has its Base Speed increased by 2.

> If either person is suffering from the Ignite status, both people are treated as having the highest severity present.

> Neither person is capable of entering Stealth through any means and if they were hidden beforehand, then they’re automatically revealed to everybody in the battlefield.

## **Pin**

When you pin an opponent, as the aggressor, you bring your opponent down to the ground usually to prepare some kind of hold. While pinning an opponent, the following effects apply:

> Both participants gain all effects of a clinch listed above and the prone condition.

> The person being pinned has their speed reduced to 0

> You may end the pin at any time reverting back to a clinch with a Speed 5, Control 5 action.

You gain access to the following action:
Set-up (Stamina 10, Speed  5, Control 5) Make an opposed grapple roll. If you succeed, your next attack against them within 10 IC gains \+3 to its accuracy and \+0.5 to its Damage Bonus for each point their Grapple Roll fails to meet yours.
