# **Requirements**

Kenjutsu is more than just Sword and Whip combat; Kenjutsu techniques go well beyond the realm of what's possible for normal humans, smashing rocks and the like. It's not exactly... easy.
There are three ways to qualify to learn a Kenjutsu technique: the first is your rank in the Athletics skill. If you're in good enough physical condition, you can pull off some pretty impressive things. The second, Research skill rank, sufficient understanding of how the move should be executed allows you to make up for your shortcomings.

Finally, rank: If you're high-enough ranking, you're able to pull enough strings and ask for enough favors to get someone to spare the time to tediously instruct you in how to perform a technique, making up for your own shortcomings.

Each rank has its own requirements, an each method meets them differently.

Rank:  
E: Genin  
C: Chuunin,Special Jounin  
B: Jounin  

Athletics:  
D: 4  
C: 10  
B: 20  
A: 30  

Research:  
D: 5  
C: 12  
B: 22  
A: 32  

Thus, if you meet any one of those requirements, you can use the jutsu in question. A Chuunin with 5 Athletics could learn all techniques up to C rank, whereas one with 20 Athletics could learn all techniques up to B rank with a mentor.

# **Stances**
Whenever you use a jutsu with stance shift you immediately enter that stance after it resolves (meaning after the delay). You can end any Stance as a Speed 3, Delay 2 Action. While in a stance using any melee weapon action ends your current stance. 

Your stance is broken in the following ways. This means your current stance ends and you enter the broken stance:

Taking a Major or higher Wound
Using any non-Weapon action or interrupt
Receiving Knockback or Stun greater than your Res/10

For example if you use a jutsu with Stance Shift Heaven, after the attack is made you enter the heaven stance. If you then use a jutsu with earth stance once the attack is made you enter earth stance and your heaven stance ends. Then using a basic weapon attack would end your earth stance. If you have 2 attacks that end their delay at the same time you may choose which attack occurs first for the purposes of stances.

Heaven Stance: 
An offense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held high above the shoulder or head, poised for lethally fast, descending strikes. When you enter this stance, your next weapon attack gains \+2 accuracy. While you remain in this stance you have a -2 to all defenses.

Earth Stance:  
A defense-oriented Stance where the weapon is held closer to the ground, typically around waist height or lower. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack increases its delay by 4. While you remain in this stance you have a +2 to all defenses.

Wrath Stance: 
The fiercest and most aggressive Stance, holding your weapon behind your head for explosive momentum. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack has its delay and speed increased by 2 and gains a \+25% wounding bonus. While you remain in this stance you are unable to dodge or parry, using either breaks your stance.

Void Stance: 
A tricky stance where you hold your weapon sideways to allow for trickier angles. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack gains the benefits of the Feint jutsu. While you remain in this stance any damage your weapon takes is increased by 10\%.

Steel Stance: 
A tactical Stance where the weapon is extended completely forward, maintaining a significant distance between the weapon master and their opponent. When you enter this stance, the next time an enemy enters your weapons reach you may use a basic melee weapon attack as an Interrupt ignoring its delay. While you remain in this stance your speed is reduced by 25\%.

Paper Stance: 
A somewhat unique stance where you point the weapon at your target and hold it on one side of your body. When you enter this stance, your next melee weapon attack becomes a Called Shot with no accuracy penalties, but has its wounding reduced by 15\%.

Broken Stance: 
Your rigorously practiced stance has been broken, and now you find yourself with an unsteady sense of balance, your weapon in an odd angle, and your body completely open to any attacks. You have a \-2 to Accuracy and Defensive Rolls while in this Stance, and if you receive a Minor or higher Wound from an Attack, you automatically fall Prone (As per the Status Condition).

Stance Shift: Void

### **Hamukau Kanjin \- Vital Strike**

Damage: \+XdS  
Speed: \+4

## **Melee Kenjutsu C-rank**

### **Chakura Nagashi \- Chakra Flow**

A technique which increases the potency of a weapon by running currents of chakra through it to enhance its existing properties or adapt it to a situation. The user must remain in physical contact with the weapon to sustain the flow of chakra, making this only effective with melee weapons.

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Requires: Chakra Control 15  

Tags: Weapon Any

Effects:  
While you activate this technique, choose an element you have affinity for. Your weapon attacks are treated as that element for any ninjutsu defenses and gain a benefit depending on the element. For weapons with the dual tag they share the benefits:

Earth: Your weapon gains Stun 2 or \+1 if the target already has Stun. This also applies to anyone who parries your weapon.

Fire: To determine damage you multiply your attack's damage by its base speed, rather than modified speed.

Lightning: Any damage reduction an opponent has is halved, and you ignore the effects of any armor they're wearing.

Water: Water's inherent fluidity and adaptability give you \+1 Accuracy and \+2 parry.

Wind: The efficacy of blocking is reduced by 30\%, and your damage is considered 20% higher for the purpose of inflicting wounds upon your enemies.

Your weapon also becomes able to parry any elemental jutsu weak to its element up to C rank, any elemental jutsu strong against it up to E Rank, and all elemental jutsu neutral to it up to D Rank. 

### **Kousanami \- Cross Wave**

A versatile and elegant technique, although one with an infinite room for mastery. The weapon master brings their weapon up or down in a sequence of diagonal, horizontal, or vertical slashes. This technique gets its name from the figure-eight motion the shinobi ends up drawing with their blade no matter which form their assault takes.

Stamina: +8  
Speed: 15 + (Weapon)/2  
Delay: +3  
Stance: Heaven/Void/Steel  

Tags: Weapon Any, Link

Effects:  
Cross Wave has only a single Accuracy, and is treated as one Attack. However, if the opponent uses a Defense where they roll for a result (such as Dodge or Parry), they must roll twice. Two-Handed weapons do not increase your damage bonus for this technique.

If they fail to defend twice your Attack's Dice Damage is doubled (From, for example, 8d8, to 8d8\*2 or 16d8) with partial success being determined by the first defense. If they only fail once they take the normal damage of the attack.

### **Ni-Tōbun \- Bisection**

Requiring as much brute strength as perfect technique, this attack is a powerful horizontal strike that aims to split the target in half. This devastating blow can cleave through guards, armor, and flesh and bone with equal ease. While simple in theory, the weapon master that is capable of performing such a brutal slash while maintaining perfect edge alignment is widely feared and respected.

Stamina: \+10  
Speed: 15 \+ (Weapon's Speed/3)  
Delay: \+4  
Accuracy: \-2  
Stance: Wrath Stance  

Tags: Slashing

Effects:  
Multiply the Total Damage of this Attack by 2. This Attack must be a Called Shot to the Torso and gains a \-50% wounding penalty. Any wound is applied to both arms and the torso. If you miss this attack gains Stance Shift: Broken.

### **Raikogeki - Thundering Strike**

Drawing your weapon back and then lunging out quickly, you make a precise strike aiming to injure, hopefully cause them to bleed out a bit. Despite the slightly weakened nature of this strike, it's rather unnerving to be poked full of holes.

Stamina: \+4  
Speed: \-4  
Delay: \+X  
Stance: Paper  

Tags: Piercing

Effects:  
X has a max of your Espionage /5. This inflicts Bleed 2 or \+1 if the target already has bleed.

Stance Shift: Paper

### **Goryū Rizumu no Jutsu \- Rumbling Dragon Beat Technique**

(Flavor Text)

Stamina: +7  
Area: PDB  
Stance: Earth/Steel  

Tags: Blunt  

Effect:  
You strike the ground with your weapon and cause a miniature earthquake to spread out and crash into anyone unlucky enough to be inside. For every Yard away from you a target is your PDB is reduced by 2 to a minimum of 0. 

This also applies Rocky Terrain 1 to its area and every consecutive use reduces its delay to zero and halves its speed. Each consecutive use has its Rocky Terrain stack up to a max of 5.

Stance Shift: Earth Stance

## **Melee Kenjutsu B-rank**

### **Hashadan \- Blade Breaker**

You deliver an overwhelmingly powerful blow, often an overhead strike, with all the force you can muster behind it; what it gains in force it loses in precision, but its real purpose is to destroy any weapons used by the victim for defense.  

Stamina: \+10  
Speed: \+2  

Tags: Weapon Any (except small)

Effects:  
This is used retroactively after an attack is successfully parried or blocked by a weapon. Your weapon is treated as being 5 times its stamina for the purposes damaging the opposing weapon’s durability.

### **Chakura Nagashi Shuusei - Chakra Flow Modification**

Converting one's chakra to an element other than their affinity is difficult; doing so with chakra flow is even more so, as it requires converting your chakra to the desired element, then reabsorbing it in a continuous stream.

Chakra: \+5  
Upkeep: \+4  
Speed: \+4  
Requires: Chakra Control 25  

Tags: Link

Effects:  
This is added on to Chakra Flow allowing you to use any element which you have an aptitude for. If you have affinity for the element this jutsu has its Upkeep reduced to \+2. Your weapon gains the ability to parry elemental jutsu of 1 rank higher. This also allows you to use Chakra Flow targeting a Bow.

### **Surīburesu To-Resshō - Three Breaths Dissolving Blows**

They say that a true master of the sword is able to cut down anybody, no matter who they were, within the span of three breaths. This technique is an expansion of that idea where the weapon master focuses on striking as many opponents as possible within an equally short time span by dashing through or past them faster than the eye can blink.

Stamina: \+X/3  
Speed: Weapon/2  
Line: 3, X  
Delay: \+5  
Stance: Any  

Tags: Weapon Any

Effects: X has a max of the amount of Yards you can normally move as part of this attack including any bonuses (such as Flash Step). You cannot move with attack normally with this jutsu.

### **Tsubasa Migaku - Blade Honing**

Despite being a fairly simple technique in concept, the precision necessary to perform it effectively, and without damaging one's blade, limits its use to more skilled shinobi.
Focusing chakra along the edge of a bladed weapon, the user creates a 'second', sharper blade of chakra that essentially increases the weapon's sharpness.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: X/2 (round up)  
Speed: 15  

Tags: Utility, Slashing  

Effects:  
X has a maximum of (your Chakra Control skill ranks)/4. One slashing weapon you are wielding gains a X \* 5% wounding bonus. If you are dual wielding you may double this jutsu’s upkeep to have it apply to both weapons.

### **Ryuuketsu Ibara - Bloody Thorns**

This technique coats the tip of a piercing weapon with a thin layer of chakra which reacts to puncturing a victim's flesh. When it does so, the chakra immediately forms a number of small thorns which tear the victim's flesh when the weapon is pulled out. The 'spikes' then return to being nothing but formless chakra, ready for the next attack.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 15  

Tags: Utility, Piercing  

Effects:  
One piercing weapon you are wielding gains Bleed 3 or +1 if the target already has Bleed. If you are dual wielding you may double this jutsu’s upkeep to have it apply to both weapons.

### **Nyoi Bō - Compliant Rod**

A technique named after a fabled weapon capable of growing from the size of a toothpick to a massive 20ft pillar. Modern practitioners are unable to change their weapons to that extent but can flow chakra through their weapons making it more malleable to change at will right before an impact to send their opponents flying.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 15  

Tags: Utility, Blunt  

Effects:  
One blunt weapon you are wielding gains Line: 3, Reach (or increases its current Line by adding them together) and increases any knockback it deals by 5. If you are dual wielding you may double this jutsu’s upkeep to have it apply to both weapons.

## **Melee Knejutsu A-rank**

### **Hien - Flying Swallow**

This technique expands upon the concepts developed when learning the Chakra Flow technique. Instead of altering the nature of chakra flowing through their weapon, the shinobi changes the shape. This is used to expand the striking or cutting surfaces of the weapon with an invisible chakra blade, point, or blunt end.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 10  

Tags: Utility, Melee  

Effects:  
Your weapon attacks gain the following: \+2 reach, its size is increased by 2, and your weapon no longer triggers most On-Contact effects.

If you're using Dual Weapons, Flying Swallow applies to both of them; otherwise, only one weapon benefits from Flying Swallow at a time. Any weapon you pick up or draw automatically benefits from Flying Swallow. If holding two non-Dual weapons, you may change which one receives this technique's effects as a Speed 0 action.

### **Hontō No Seigi - True Justice**

Stamina: \+4  
Damage: None  
Speed: 5  
Delay: 0  

Tags: Melee, Interrupt  

Effects:   
True Justice is used as a Weapon Parry with a +2 Bonus and can be used even while in Wrath Stance. If you successfully defend, True Justice immediately acts as an attack, increasing its Speed and Stamina by 5, and using the results of your parry roll as its Accuracy. The attack used is determined by the stance (if any) you were in ignoring any normal restrictions:

None: Basic Weapon Attack  
Heaven: Falling Moon  
Earth: Rising Sun  
Wrath: Headsplitter  
Void: Wide Swing  
Steel: Tactical Retreat  
Paper: Vital Strike  
Broken: Twisting Stab  

Also on a success this jutsu gains Stance Shift: Any (trumping any Stance Shift the jutsu used may have).
