# **1 Point Uniques**

### **Alert**

As far as ninja are concerned, real ninja, you are their worst nightmare. You can see beyond the unseen, making you a feared weapon. 

You have a \+3 bonus to Awareness and Espionage rolls, and your ranks in the Blind Fighting and Keen Senses and Sixth Sense abilities are considered 1 higher than the actual rank you have them at (even above the normal maximum). 

Whenever you are the target of a Surprise Attack or a Sneak Attack made from stealth, you can immediately after resolving the attack perform a Search action as a Speed 0 Interrupt .

Upgrades Into: Chakra Sensor

### **Applied Knowledge**

Where others use talent, you rely on practical application of your (probably vast) knowledge to guide you. It's all well and good for someone to be able to spot the vague outline of a hidden opponent, but you, on the other hand, notice the way the bush they're hiding behind has been shifted, as you know that plant only grows facing west. You also know that the plant's name is Rhaphiolepis, a shrubbery that's typically grown for the pink flowers that it blooms. And you know those flowers are great for making tea. And that they're- Yeah.... You're probably kind of a nerd, to be honest. 

You increase the max rank of all non-Research skills by your (Research Ranks)/5. Furthermore, all this attention to detail has the added benefit of making you pretty good at crafting realistic Genjutsu with consistent details. The duration’s multiplier for when somebody realizes they’re trapped in a genjutsu is increased by 2\. For example, if they normally realize it within X\*3 ICs, it becomes X\*5 ICs.

Upgrades Into: Cunning

### **Blur**

It's hard to track you when you move, almost as if you can turn your own inertia on and off at will\! 

Your movement speed is increased by 20%, and Shunshin has no Chakra Exhaustion cost (though retains its normal Speed). Whenever you successfully dodge, you may move as many yards as if you'd taken a Speed 4 move action.

Upgrades Into: Exceptionally Fast

### **Close Ties**

Your allies are incredibly important to you, each valued as much as a close friend. You form bonds fast, and they can last for life. You know how to bring out the best in the people you fight alongside with and can inspire them to overcome the greatest obstacles. Your mere presence raises morale\! 

When fighting alongside at least one Ally, you gain \+3 to your Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls. Your designated Allies also gain this Bonus.

You can spend Willpower to allow an Ally to ignore one Major or higher wound they are suffering from for the remainder of the fight. The cost for doing so is 1 WP for a Major wound, 2 WP for a Severe wound and 3 WP for a Critical wound. Each Ally can only benefit from this effect once in a given combat. You can go into Negative WP when using this ability, though you cannot use it if you have 0 or less WP remaining (Negative WP recovers at the same rate as normal WP).

In order for someone to qualify as an Ally, you must have fought with or against them.

Upgrades Into: Protector

### **Chemist**

Chemistry is often a misunderstood and mistrusted science in the world of the Shinobi. And for good reason, there are many ninjas that had drawn their last breath due to an explosive tag, or who have had the tides turn against them thanks to a well timed smoke or flash bomb thrown just at the critical moment. Not to mention, worse of all, that no chemist worth their salt hasn't at least dabbled in the foul arts of poison making. Yet even with all of that, the benefits of such a field of study are undeniable, and those who pursue it despite such difficulty will eventually find any "friends" who'll appreciate their talents.

Your maximum Toxicology and Artisan \[Craftsman\] Ranks are increased by 3\.

Whenever you use a Downtime Action to create Blood Increasing Pills, Explosive Tags, Smoke Bombs, or Flash Bombs, you produce twice the normal amount. This includes Custom Smoke Bombs. Additionally, the Soldier Pills that you produce are simply of a better quality and stability, with Crafted Soldier Pills providing a \+15 CE and Stamina bonus instead of the normal \+10.

Additionally, you automatically create 1 dose of Antidote for free whenever you successfully brew a batch of Poison.

### **Elementally Gifted**

While most shinobi struggle to learn the basics of elemental control, you took to it like a fish to water (or a bird to wind, or... you know what, this joke is just bad). Your early aptitude is the first sign of a potential that'll leave even many experienced shinobi envious. 

You can use an element of your choice as if you had the Elemental Aptitude ability for it, without actually having to use one of your ranks of Elemental Aptitude.

Also, you can apply the effects of your Elemental Affinity ability to that Element as well.

Upgrades Into: Elementalist

### **Expansive Chakra**

Chakra flows readily through your body and into your jutsu, allowing you to effortlessly mold it into techniques. 

The Chakra costs for all your jutsu are reduced by 1 \+ 1 per rank (2 for E-rank, 3 for D-rank), and your ninjutsu damage bonus is increased by half that amount (1 for E-rank, 1.5 for D-rank, and so forth).

Upgrades Into: Boundless Chakra

### **Entrepreneur**

You have golden tipped fingers\! You possess the management talent, connections, and just general good fortune to profit far more than your peers from any investment, job, or activity which involves Ryo. This has led you to become quite a resourceful ninja. Be it tools, traps, or weapons, you are always ready for any situation. 

Whenever you gain Ryo from a Mission Reward, Downtime Action, Trading (With NPCs), or your Occupation, you earn twice the amount of Ryo you would have normally earned. If you need to make an Espionage or Diplomacy Roll to bribe someone, it has a \+5 bonus. 

You may spend Ryo spontaneously, even in the middle of a mission, representing you having just the right thing for the task at hand. Done in combat, this is a Speed 2 action.

### **Hidden Potential**

You and your peers both have yet to realize the full extent of your capabilities. Maybe you just haven't found your niche, maybe you're a late bloomer, or maybe something's holding you back. Until you find out what it is, you have \+3 Willpower.

Upgrades Into: Any 2- or 3-point unique.

### **Indefatigable**

(adj) 1\. (of a person or their efforts) Persisting tirelessly. That's what you are\! 

You have a \+1 bonus to Stamina rolls per rank of the jutsu being used (+1 for E-ranks, \+2 for D-ranks, etc.); in the case of basic attacks, this becomes a \+2 bonus.

Additionally, when you Rest you may have your Stamina penalty lowered by an additional 1 point.

Upgrades Into: Endless Energy

### **Killing Intent**

You have what it takes to end a person's life. Even if you personally would choose not to, it's not because you lack the capacity. Something about you gives that away, that killer's instinct having seeped into your very chakra.

Whenever you inflict a wound upon someone, you and your victim roll 1d20+Double your Current Willpower, with \+1 to your roll for every Wound you've inflicted in that battle (Including the one that triggered this roll). If they fail, they receive a Stun with a severity of how much you beat their roll by with a cap of (Minor \= 5, Major \= 10 Severe \= 20, Critical \= No cap)

### **Lightfoot**

You've always been talented at sneaking and hiding in almost any and all places. Whether a dark shadow or henge'd as a tissue box in a room, you know how make your presence scarce.

You have a \+3 bonus to Stealth rolls, and the speed of your Hide action is reduced by 3\. You can move when in Stealth 2 without lowering the level of your stealth.

Upgrades Into: Skirmisher

### **Martial Prowess**

You’re adept at turning a fight into a one-man training montage with your enemy being a rag doll disoriented by every blow. You have no need for weapons: You are the weapon. 

Your Combos are not broken when attacking a new target. 

You gain a \+3 bonus to Counter Combo opposed rolls, and all your Combo jutsu have “Stun 1” added to their Combo Counter line. Additionally, your combos are not broken by a Stun of a severity less than (Combo Counter \+2).

Upgrades Into: Bruiser

### **Nimble Hands**

You have always been able to pick things up, spin them between your fingers, throw things just right, and otherwise use your hands well. 

You may throw up to DEX/8 weapons with a multi-throw and reduce Seal Speeds and the Speed of ranged attacks by 2\.

In addition to this, in response to an attack, you may draw any object that provides you a special interrupt and use it against that attack (For example, Weapon Block)

Upgrades Into: Fan of Knives, Single-Handed Seals

### **Silver Tongued**

Your talents do not reside in throwing the sharpest kicks or shooting the biggest lightning bolts like other Shinobi. Instead, you've made it so far with nothing more than a big mouth, more backbone than wits, and a hefty vocabulary of quite the colorful language to your name. All of which you masterfully abuse to get under people's skins during combat. You love nothing more than to stand there defiantly while you hurl verbal and physical assault with pinpoint precision. Even the calmest of hearts are liable to get thrown off their game with you around, and unless they focus their attention on you, you'll always be a distraction at the back of their minds. Most people probably don't like you, but hey, they're all probably thin skinned losers anyway so who cares about them\!

You gain the following actions:

Mock (Speed 6, Interrupt)  
You know just how to get under peoples skin and make them lose their cool in combat causing them to make mistakes for you to exploit. When a shinobi that can hear you makes an attack or defensive roll you may force them to roll 2d20 and take the lowest roll instead of their normal accuracy or defensive roll. Every time you take this action the speed increases by 1 the next time it's used against the same person in a day.

Jeer (Speed 3, Interrupt)  
It's often difficult to focus on a task when you have someone pestering your ear with an endless wave of mockery and insults relating to your mother. In response to someone who can hear you making a skill roll you may use this feature for the duration to give them a \-5 to the roll. For every time you’ve used this against a target in a day the penalty is reduced by 2 (to \-3, \-1,and finally 0).

Your maximum ranks in Diplomacy increases by 1\.

Upgrades Into: Imposing Presence

### **Scheduled**

You have perfect time management skills and are extremely organized and orderly. Maybe you were disciplined from a young age under a strict, military household. Or maybe you just actually listened to your mom whenever she told you to do your chores, and the habits stuck. Either way, you've come to understand that there is efficiency in patterns and order. You never leave a task for later, and can operate at your best even when-or rather, especially when you have to commit the same repetitive work or motions for hours on end. You'd make for an excellent craftsman\!... Or somebody's maid or butler... Hey, just think about it, alright? You could save both of you so much time.

You have two additional Downtime Slots.

Upgrades Into: Fixer

### **Seal Master**

You're really, really good with handseals. You make them fast, and mold your chakra just as rapidly. It could be natural talent... but, honestly, you know what it probably was? Probably when you were a kid you were incredibly obsessed with being a super-cool ninja, so you spent all your free time making fake handseals and pretending to shoot fireballs at your friends. 

You reduce Seal Speeds by Dex/8 (instead of Dex/10), and any jutsu whose Seal Speed is reduced to 0 has a 10% bonus to its Total Damage.

Upgrades Into: Jutsu Master, Single-Handed Seals

### **Weapon Master**

You know your weapons. You know how to use them, and how to change them to suit your style. 

You may draw and sheath Weapons as a Speed 0 Action.

You may draw a small weapon as part of an Interrupt.

Your Weapon Focus ability applies to all weapons, only needing to be taken once, and it only increases Stamina costs by 2 per rank. 

Additionally, that ability's limit is changed to (DEX \-30)/20, maximum 4\. If you take this after creation, you may refund your extra Weapon Focus.

### **Weight Trainer**

You strap yourself down with weights--either from tailoring your clothes that way, or from strapping weights to your limbs--and hamper yourself constantly. All in the name of constant training and to surprise your opponents with a sudden burst of ability..

So long as you start a fight with your Weights On (this must be declared during init), you have a special Weights Action Points Pool (WAP Pool). Any time you would acquire AP during the fight, an equal amount of AP is stored in your WAP Pool. Your WAP Pool has the same maximum as your normal AP Pool.

Once per combat, as a Speed 6, Delay 6 Action that cannot be reduced further, you can shed your Weights. At this moment you gain access to your WAP Pool and can spend AP from this pool as if it were your regular AP. You do not acquire any more WAP once you do this.

Due to the incredible amount of athleticism this lifestyle requires, your athletics skill cap is raised by 3\.
