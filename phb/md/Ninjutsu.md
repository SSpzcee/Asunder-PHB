## **General E-rank**

### **Bunshin no Jutsu \- Clone Technique**

One of the three basic ninja techniques, this creates one or more intangible copies of the user. These are nothing but weak constructs of chakra, and cannot interact with the world around them--though they can speak.

Chakra: 10 \+ 3 per clone  
Speed: 6 \+ 1 per clone  
Seal Speed: 4 \+ 1 per clone

Effects:  
You may create up to 3 clones. During this process you can 'hide' among your clones, making it impossible to tell which one is the fake. Any targeting you must roll 1d(1 \+ number of clones). On a roll of 1, it targets you; on anything else, it aims at a clone; clones cannot dodge, parry, or use jutsu. A clone that's been hit is destroyed; if you're hit, your clones remain but are mostly useless (as you've been identified by your opponents). If you make new clones (of the same type, or a different variety), all your pre-existing ones are immediately destroyed.

Several other actions related to this jutsu are significant.

Hide Among Clones (Speed 4, or Speed \+6) You pull off a quick shell-game maneuver, confusing your opponents. If they've singled you out from your clones, and you're free to maneuver, you may do this to hide yourself. You roll Stealth against their Awareness skill; success means you've once again concealed yourself. Doing this alone is a Speed 4 action, but it may also be used with another action (such as an attack) by increasing that action's Speed by 6\.

Observe (Speed 4\) Anyone can try to observe you and your clones to try and find a discrepancy, such as the clones not casting shadows or not leaving footprints behind. This allows them to make an Awareness roll against your Chakra Control; if they succeed, they can tell you apart from all your clones, and recognize those clones as such, until you hide among them again.

### **Henge no Jutsu \- Transformation Technique**

This technique is as common as it is basic, yet to the ordinary civilian it's one of the most mysterious and feared capabilities ninja possess: the power to take the shape of another person. With this jutsu a ninja can alter their appearance to match that of another person or object. If used to transform into anything but another human, it only lets you take on the thing's shape and basic physical characteristics: turning into a rock wouldn't make you nearly invulnerable, turning into a bird would not let you fly, and while you could transform into a particularly large shuriken your 'edges' would be too dull to cut with--in the last case, however, you would be fairly aerodynamic.

Chakra: 5  
Upkeep: 0  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 4

Effects:  
You look like another person. At a glance, this is nearly flawless. Of course, the technique has many weaknesses: if you don't know about, say, a birthmark, then your Henge wouldn't reproduce it.  
If someone interacts with you and knows the person you're trying to imitate, they have an opposed Awareness roll vs your Espionage (with them receiving a \+5 bonus; or \+10 if it's someone they know exceptionally well, such as a sibling or loved one) against yours to see through the Henge.  
Beyond just that roll, there are ways a Henge can automatically be seen through--not knowing a password, or saying something the person you're trying to imitate would never say.  
On the other hand, you could just Henge into someone other than yourself.  
If you try to turn into some piece of scenery, any ninja who come within 10 yards of you have a chance to notice the deception; you have an Espionage roll with a \+10 bonus against their Awareness to remain concealed.  
Any time you take damage, your Henge effect ends immediately; it's just an inherent flaw in the technique.

### **Kawarimi no Jutsu \- Substitution Technique**

The final of the three basic ninja techniques--along with Bunshin and Henge--is the substitution technique, allowing a ninja to move so quickly they cannot be seen by the naked eye and replace themselves with a wooden log (don't ask where the wooden logs come from) or other harmless object.

Chakra: 10  
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: \+4  
Seal Speed: 4

Effects:  
This technique is activated after you have failed to dodge an attack, but the damage would be reduced by partial defense. In the case of non-damaging techniques, this can be used whenever it hits by 5 points or less. As long as the dodge's new Speed (including the \+4 from Substitution, and its Seal Speed) would still be valid for interrupting (you may spend AP to reduce Kawarimi's Speed, as usual, but may not reduce the original dodge's speed at this point), you can pay 5 AP to fully dodge that attack.  
Each time you use Kawarimi, its AP cost is increased by 5 for the rest of that battle. The second time you used Kawarimi would cost 10 AP, the third would cost 15 AP, and so forth. If Kawarimi's Seal Speed is reduced to 0, you can perform it without handseals.  
After successful use of Kawarimi, you may immediately attempt to Hide. Doing so has a cumulative \-2 penalty each time after that you use Kawarimi to do this in a single battle. Used this way, your opponent is allowed an immediate Awareness roll against your Stealth TN (though this does not apply to the cumulative bonus they would get for searching for you).

### **Ninshiki Kaado \- Ninja Info Cards**

This jutsu uses specially prepared cards capable of being encoded with chakra. Although the cards appear blank, anyone familiar with this technique will be able to identify them.  
The cards themselves are a trivial purchase (no cost or equipment entry associated with them). When chakra is applied to them (via use of this jutsu) they can be encoded with hidden information. This information can be retrieved the same way, but only by the person who stored the information to begin with.

Chakra: 5  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 4  
Seal Speed: 7

Effects:  
Performing this technique requires a surface to rest the cards on as they are encoded, one at a time, with chakra. Essentially any kind of information (images, graphs, maps, text) can be placed on the cards, though their size is a limiting factor. Since these can not be used to pass messages, they're typically used for more mundane uses, like holding ones shopping list.

## **General D-rank**  

### **Genjutsu Kai \- Genjutsu Release**

The most common and perhaps most effective method of combatting genjutsu, if one ends up caught up in one and aware enough to realize it. Kai involves temporarily stopping the flow of chakra throughout the body, and then sending a burst to the brain in an attempt to force the attacker's chakra from their body.

Chakra: 10 \+ X  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 5

Effects:  
This can be done on yourself, or someone else, but you must be able to touch the other person when performing the jutsu. This allows the person it's used on to make another roll against a Genjutsu affecting them, with a bonus of X. X has a limit of (5+XP/300). You also gain an additional \+2 for every time you’ve used genjutsu kai in a row. This may also be done against area-of-effect genjutsu, in which case this technique's user makes a genjutsu roll against the original roll made by whoever put the technique in place. If successful, the technique is dispelled in its entirety.

### **Shunshin no Jutsu \- Body Flicker Technique**

A high-speed movement technique which allows the user to travel incredibly distances in the blink of eye; used by a sufficiently powerful ninja, this can be mistaken for teleportation by an untrained observer.

Chakra: 10  
Speed: 2

Effects:  
You move as far as you could in a Speed X move action, where X is how many AP you choose to spend on this technique. There is no limit on how many AP you may spend. You may use this in addition to normal movement to help dodge an area-of-effect technique. Use your AP spent, in addition to the Speed of the attack and your normal movement speed, to determine how close to the edge of the effect you can get. This increases the Speed of your dodge by 2\.

### **Kanashibari no Jutsu \- Temporary Paralysis Technique**

This technique temporarily restrains the victim with chakra, as if they were bound by invisible steel chains. Used effectively, it can temporarily debilitate a target for a short period of time.

Chakra: 16  
Range: 20  
Special: Stun 5, Paralysis 4  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 8

Effects:  
This technique's Paralysis ends once its stun has expired. If used on an already-stunned victim, the Paralysis lasts until they recover from that stun.

### **Utsusemi no Jutsu \- Cicada Shell Technique**

One of the oldest, most iconic techniques possessed by ninjas, in the eyes of civilians. It's very useful for the ninja who are concerned with acting "ninja-like", as it allows a shinobi to project their voice over an area while concealing their presence. This means that a shinobi can talk to someone without giving away their location, and can also be very unnerving.  
This isn't a megaphone, and it doesn't let you broadcast your voice over entire towns. Your voice won't carry any farther than it normally would, but it seems to be coming from all around.

Chakra: 5  
Upkeep: 0  
Speed: 2  
Seal Speed: 4

Effects:  
As described above, you can speak freely while hidden without giving people any indication of where you might be hiding.  
Activating Utsusemi while in hiding does not break stealth (unlike normal ninjutsu).

### **Haruka Bakuhatsu no Jutsu \- Remote Detonation Technique**

Explosives are useful; and, more importantly, who doesn't love explosions? However, needing to be at ground zero of an impending explosion to set tags off is something which many shinobi, understandably, have reservations about, and severely diminishes the potential tactical uses.  
Hence, this technique\! It allows a shinobi to detonate multiple exploding tags from a distance--not as great a distance as most would like, or as many as most shinobi would prefer, but it's better than doing it the old-fashioned way.

Chakra: 10 \+ X \* 3  
Range: CHA/10 yards  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 4 \+ X \* 2

Effects:  
You detonate up to (Chakra Control skill ranks)/5 exploding tags within this technique's range. This only works on tags which you have primed. X is the number of tags you detonate.  
When using this technique, you may select a delay between 10 and (10 \+ Chakra Control skill ranks) IC--after that much time has passed, the tags will explode, damaging anyone within their range as usual.

## **General C-rank**  

### **Sanzengarasu no Jutsu \- Scattering One Thousand Crows Technique**

This summons a flock of chakra-created and \-guided crows which surround and disorient them. The crows continuously multiply and clone themselves, and will soon surround the target entirely.

Chakra: 25  
Range: 40  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 13

Effects:  
This inflicts a -1 visibility penalty which increases every 10 IC until reaching -10; 10 IC after that, it dissipates entirely. It can not  be dodged.

The application of an area-of-effect that deals damage to the target will destroy the crows.

### **Kawara Shuriken \- Roof Tile Shuriken**

This technique lifts up nearby roof tiles and launches them at an opponent. The chakra used starts the tiles spinning and allows them to be controlled remotely, in addition to making them far stronger than normal roof tiles would be.

Chakra: Special  
Damage: Special  
Accuracy: \+2  
Range: CHA/3  
Speed: Special  
Seal Speed: 10

Effects:  
This requires you to be in a city or other area which has roofs (with tiles).  
This is treated as a multi-throw, with the Chakra cost replacing the Stamina cost. You may 'throw' up to CHA/10 roof tiles, which deal 2d10 damage each. The Speed is the normal Speed of a multi-throw launching that many projectiles.  
This technique inflicts Blunt wounds.

### **Chakra Strengthening**

A fairly simple, yet often impractically demanding technique. The user channels chakra into their limbs, increasing their speed and strength. Despite being very good at what it does, it rapidly takes a toll on one's energy reserves.

Chakra: 5 \* X  
Stamina: 5 \* X  
Upkeep: 2 \+X
Speed: 2

Effects:  
You have a \+X bonus to your physical damage bonus and dodge for the next 30 IC. X has a maximum of 5\. When this jutsu ends you may choose to extend it’s duration by 30 IC by paying its cost \- 5\.  
You can decide whether to use Stamina or Chakra for this technique's fatigue cost, but once you’ve made that choice, all future uses of Chakra Strengthening in this fight will use that choice.

### **Soushuujin \- Manipulating Attack Blades**

This technique allows the user to briefly levitate multiple kunai in mid-air using chakra, and then direct them at an opponent, more quickly than if each was being thrown individually.

Chakra: Special  
Damage: Special  
Speed: 4 \+ Special

Effects:  
This supplements a multi-throw action. The Chakra cost is equal to the multi-throw's Stamina cost; the Damage is that of the multi-throw, though your ninjutsu, rather than physical, damage bonus is used. You use CHA/10, rather than DEX/10, to determine how many kunai you may throw.  
Because this technique essentially throws the projectiles in a straight line, and lacks something in precision, it cannot be used with shuriken (of any form) or senbon; only kunai. The Speed is 4, plus half the Speed of the regular multithrow action.

### **Kuchiyose no Jutsu \- Summoning Technique**

One of the simplest techniques in the esoteric discipline of space-time ninjutsu, the summoning technique allows a ninja- \-the summoner--to transport creatures over great distances instantly.  
Most of these summons take the form of giant, intelligent animals.

Chakra: Varies  
Speed: Varies  
Seal Speed: Varies  
Requires: Summoning Contract

Effects:  
Even if you know this technique, you may not summon anything until you have a contract with it. These are supernatural contracts with, as mentioned above, supernatural animals.  
What you can summon, and what it does, depends on the nature of the contract. These contracts are often known as "blood contracts", both because they're signed in blood, and because performing Kuchiyose no Jutsu requires an offering of the user's blood. It's not very much; a few drops will suffice, as long as it's fresh. Some ninja will make a small cut on their arm or palm, though dedicated summoners prefer the rather unsightly expedient of biting themselves, often on the pad or back of their thumb, hard enough to draw blood--summoning-focused shinobi can sometimes be identified by the small, deep scars in those locations.  
If you have a summoning contract (usually obtained from the Summoning Contract talent) you can learn Kuchiyose no Jutsu without meeting the normal requirements to learn Crank ninjutsu.

### **Kikkake Bakuhatsu no Jutsu \- Triggered Detonation Technique**

Explosives are, to say the least, useful. Unfortunately, their utility as traps is severely limited by the fact that, normally, someone must be nearby watching over them to have them explode when necessary.  
This technique allows tags to be set to detonate in advance, which both makes them viable as traps and allows the shinobi who placed them to attend to other matters.

Chakra: 15 \+ 5 \* X  
Speed: 20 \+ X \* 10

Effects:  
You place X tags (up to a maximum of Chakra Control)/5. One or more (up to 'all') of these tags may be designated as 'triggers'. When performing this technique specify a range between 0 and (Chakra Control ranks)/5 yards, and a time between 10 IC and 10 \+ (Chakra Control ranks) IC.  
Whenever someone comes in that many yards of a trigger tag, all the other tags it is linked with (by that usage of Triggered Detonation) will detonate that many IC later.  
Tags placed with this technique may not be set off via Remote Detonation, nor may they be part of more than one 'set' of Triggered Detonation tags. All tags linked by a single usage of Triggered Detonation must be within (Chakra Control ranks) yards of each other.

 

### **Kyousanken no Jutsu \- Iron Curtain Technique**

The user places themself under a harmless genjutsu, which itself serves no purpose but makes it more difficult for other genjutsu to affect you normally.

Chakra: 20  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 12

Effects: So long as this technique's upkeep is maintained, you have a \+4 bonus to defensive genjutsu rolls. This genjutsu does not end when you're wounded. You may declare Iron Curtain as an Interrupt when targeted with genjutsu, following the normal rules for defensive interrupts and giving you its bonus for that defensive genjutsu roll. Iron Curtain does remain active (as if activated normally) after being used this way.

## **General B-rank**  

### **Shoushagan no Jutsu \- Vanishing Facial Copy Technique**

Developed for spying and infiltration, this technique is highly effective, but grisly enough that most shinobi will deign not to even learn how to perform it, regardless of its efficacy. With this technique, you steal the face off of a corpse and make it your own.

Chakra: 15  
Speed: 10

Effects:  
You physically remove the face from a corpse and place it on top of yours. The body in question must be recently deceased (within the past 24 hours) and not grievously mutilated (no Severe or higher Head wounds).  
Your voice and skin tone will change to match that of the person whose face you stole, but your height, build, and gender will not. The face merges with your own seamlessly.  
Unlike henge, use of this technique is completely undetectable by doujutsu and similar chakra-viewing effects.  
This can be maintained indefinitely, but a Major or worse Head wound of any sort will cause the stolen face to tear, revealing (part of) your own beneath it. Aside from being a fairly disturbing sight, this sort of ruins the subterfuge aspects of the technique. At that point, your face and skin tone return to normal.  
You may peel off and discard the face at will, ending this jutsu whenever you please. A discarded face cannot be reused.  
Learning this techniques causes you to have a one-time increase of \+10 Infamy.

### **Senri Bakuhatsu no Jutsu \- Long-Range Detonation Technique**

An improvement to the more basic remote detonation technique. As ninja become more powerful, they inevitably find themselves needing bigger explosions, and by extension, the ability to not get caught in their own explosions.

Chakra: 15 \+ X \* 4  
Range: CHA/5 yards  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 6 \+ X \* 3  
Requires: Remote Detonation Technique

Effects:  
You detonate up to (Chakra Control skill rank)/5 exploding tags within this technique's range, with X being the number of tags you detonate. In all other regards, it functions identically to the D-rank Remote Detonation Technique.

### **Kekkai Houjin \- Barrier Encampment Method**

One of the most tried-and-true methods of setting traps using explosives, this puts an array of four explosive tags around the boundary of an area. If anyone tries to pass through the area the tags will detonate, spelling misfortune for the target.  
Rumors of this technique "misfiring" and eradicating deer and bears are largely fabricated. Humans and summon animals will trigger it, but not ordinary fauna.

Chakra: 30  
Range: Special  
Requires: Triggered Detonation

Effects:  
This technique cannot be used in combat, as it takes a few minutes to set up appropriately. You place four exploding tags at the corner of a square or rectangle, facing inwards; they can be hidden if you have the Tag Concealment ability.  
Each side of the square they form can be up to double the Area of the tags you're using in length. When someone moves to leave the area (meaning if they travel in any direction from the center, or get part way in and then turn around), the tags will detonate 10 IC later. Anyone who hasn't escaped the area (or otherwise defended themselves) by then will take the combined damage of three exploding tags, regardless of their location within the boundary.  
Notably, anyone outside the 'barrier' is unharmed; part of this technique is that it directs all the explosive force inwards.  
Directional defenses (such as Earth Shore Return) are insufficient to protect against this, a the explosion originates from multiple directions.

### **Hari Jizou \- Needle Jizo**

By directing chakra into their hair, the shinobi causes it to grow rapidly. This results in their hair not only getting longer, but also growing in volume and hardening into what amounts to a forest of sharp, needle-thin and iron-hard spikes. Even the best-groomed hair becomes wild and spiky under the effects of this technique\! This can be used for a number of derivative techniques, and on its own provides a surprisingly strong defense, as the hair will wrap around its owner to protect them from attacks.  
When this technique ends, the user's hair returns to its normal length.

Chakra: 20+3\*X  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 15  
Upkeep: X

Effects:  
X has a maximum of 10\. Your hair's length increases by X feet\! However, now you have a lot of bulky, chakra-strengthened hair, that gets in the way when you're trying to do super-fast ninja battles. When dodging, or moving as part of an attack, you suffer an X/2 immobilization penalty (rounded up); in the case of moving while attacking, this applies to the distance you can move, the Accuracy of the attack itself, and anything else you may need to do until the next IC.  
You gain a Damage Reduction of (Ninjutsu damage bonus)\* (X)/2, which is doubled while blocking. Additionally, the damage you take is considered (2.5)\*(X)% lower for the purposes of determining wounds. Anyone attacking you from a distance of (X/3) yards or less will take (your ninjutsu damage bonus)\*(speed of their attack) damage; this does not apply if X is 2 or lower. So long as X is 3 or higher, this applies to all melee attacks.  
As a Speed 10, Chakra 5+5\*Y action, you may increase X's value by Y, up to the maximum of 10\.  
Whenever you suffer an Ignite effect, X is reduced by half the Ignite's severity; whenever your suffer a Slashing wound, X is reduced by 1 per level of the wound's severity (1 for a Minor, 2 for a Major, and so on).  
If X is reduced to 0, this technique ends.

### **Hari Jigoku \- Needle Hell**

While Needle Jizo is active, the shinobi focuses more chakra into their hair. There is a telltale bristling and very obvious 'aiming' of their hair, before they fire of hundreds of sharpened hair-needles at nearby enemies. While these are very tiny, there are enough of them, moving fast enough, to pose a credible threat to all but the hardiest of shinobi.

Chakra: 25  
Damage: 10d4\*X  
Speed: 15, Delay 5  
Seal Speed: 0  
Area: Line X yards wide, to a range of X\*5 yards  
Requires: Needle Jizo active

Effects:  
X is a value up to Needle Jizo's current Upkeep; after using Needle Hell, Needle Jizo's Upkeep (and other, related effects) are reduced by X. When performing Needle Hell, you multiply your ninjutsu damage bonus by the lower of (X\*2) or the technique's Speed; thus, if you did not lower its Speed with AP, and set X \= 4, you would roll damage as 10d4\*4+(ninjutsu damage bonus)\*8.  
When this technique's Delay ends, anyone in the area will be automatically struck by the flying needles; raising ninjutsubased defenses ahead of time (such as Earth Shore Return or Water Encampment Wall) is explicitly allowed and automatically successful, but no defensive interrupts (such as dodging) function against this technique. In addition, any Damage Reduction a victim has is doubled against Needle Hell's damage.

### **Ranjishigami no Jutsu \- Art of the Raging Lion's Mane**

Using their empowered hair, the Shinobi extends and manipulates it to grapple with and usually heavily damage their target.

Chakra: 35  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 20  
Range: X\*10 yards  
Requires: Needle Jizo active

Effects:  
This technique uses the current upkeep of Needle Jizo as X.  
When using this technique, make an Accuracy roll which ignores immobilization penalties. If it hits, your hair grapples the target; you may then immediately use a Grapple technique of B-rank or lower that you know, with no Stamina or Chakra cost, at only half its normal Speed, as if you had your opponent pinned. So long as your hair maintains this grapple, you may continue to use it to perform grapple techniques; your hair has up to X 'limbs', for the purposes of determining which locks and holds you can maintain. All Grapple techniques after the first use their normal Speed, and have a Chakra cost equal to (and replacing) their normal Stamina cost.  
Techniques performed this way use (ninjutsu damage bonus \+ X) rather than your physical bonus. You use CHA in place of STR for your damage dice and grapple checks, and have a \+X bonus to your grapple rolls and grapple TNs with Art of the Raging Lion's Mane. If an opponent fails an Escape Grapple attempt by 20 or more, they are unable to break free; Escape Grapple simply fails, with a Speed of 4 and a Stamina cost of (4 \+ the amount they fail by, as normal).  
You do not suffer any of the normal downsides from being involved in a grapple, and your opponent cannot perform grapple techniques against you. f you and your victim move more than this technique's range from one another, they break free automatically. Once they do break free, your Needle Jizo ends (its X being set to 0). If you end Art of the Raging Lion's Mane yourself, however, Needle Jizo is not ended prematurely, but this can only be done on your IC.  
While using Art of the Raging Lion's Mane you do not receive any of Needle Jizo's normal benefits, but do suffer its normal penalties.

## **General A-rank**  

### **Meisaigakure no Jutsu \- Hiding With Camouflage Technique**

An advanced technique where a ninja distorts how light is reflected around their body with chakra inflections, which makes them almost invisible to most normal senses.  
Chakra: 35  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
This technique may be used when already in Stealth; it raises you to level 3 Stealth. If you end this technique's Upkeep, you are lowered to level 2 Stealth. If you break your Stealth for some other reason (such as moving, or attacking), then Meisaigakure also ends.  
Once hidden by Meisaigakure, you are effectively invisible so long as you maintain its Upkeep. You could use this in the middle of a room and then go unnoticed when a group of people entered and had a conversation--though it does not make you intangible.  
If an enemy has a heightened sense of smell (such as an Inuzuka's ninken) or a doujutsu capable of viewing chakra, then your Stealth TN is considered 10 points lower (as if you were only in level 2 Stealth) for the purposes of hiding from them.

### **Bunshin Daibakuha \- Clone Great Explosion**

Fundamentally, most clones are little more than dense, mobile bundles of chakra. This technique takes advantage of that by essentially converting them into bombs, overloading them with the user's chakra and sending them to converge on a single point before exploding.

Chakra: Special  
Range: CHA/4  
Area: 25  
Speed: 16, Delay 6 \+ Special  
Seal Speed: 24

Effects:  
After finishing this technique's handseals, some or all (your choice) of your clones will charge towards a specific location before exploding. Clones activated with this technique can no longer take any other actions, but nor can they be destroyed by other means, and they no longer provide the normal benefits of clones (that is, the chance that an opponent will accidentally strike them instead of you). In the case of clones capable of using jutsu, any Upkeeps they're maintaining end immediately.  
The "Special" portion of the Delay is however long it would take the clones to move from your current location to the center of the explosion (the location you target with this technique). They move at full speed, though immobilization penalties (such as from the ground being turned to mud) may still slow them down.  
Anyone hit by the explosion is allowed a Resistance roll against your Chakra Control (including you, if you're hit).  
Those who passes their roll take only half damage, and suffer half the normal status effects (excepting the visibility penalty from water clone explosions, as it is based on the location, rather than who it hits).  
Like the explosions from Exploding Tags, it is not possible to dodge the detonation of this technique. Each type of clone is considered to be an elemental ninjutsu of its appropriate element (shadow clones being non-elemental). Mud, Water, and Shadow Clones inflict Blunt wounds. Rock Clones deal Slashing damage, and Lightning Clones cause Energy wounds.

*Mud Clones*  
Chakra: 10, \+10/clone  
Damage: 20d20\*1 per clone  
Anyone hit suffers an Immobilization penalty of 2, \+2 per clone. This penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 10 IC.

*Rock Clones:*  
Chakra: 15/clone  
Damage: 25d20\*1 per clone  
Anyone hit suffers a Bleed status of 5/clone, and a Stun of 3/clone.

*Lightning Clones:*  
Chakra: 10, \+20/clone  
Damage: 3d100.open(60) per clone  
Anyone hit suffers a Paralyze 4 if one clone was used, or 8 for two clones. This penalty is halved (round down for the new value) every 20 IC.

*Water:*  
Chakra: 12/clone  
Damage: 8d20+100, per clone  
When the clones explode, they do so with enough concussive force to daze anyway hit. They inflict a visibility penalty of \-4/clone, which cannot be mitigated by the Blind Fighting ability.  
The penalty is halved (round down) every 10 IC. After the clones explode, the water used to create them (4 gallons per clone) is returned to the battlefield.

*Shadow:*  
Damage: 15d20.open(11) per clone  
Stun: 15+5/clone  
Performing Clone Explosion with Shadow Clones has no Chakra cost.

### **Shuriken Kage Bunshin no Jutsu \- Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique**

Based on the same principle as the much-more-advanced Shadow Clone technique, this creates copies of an object rather than a shinobi: specifically, as the name suggests, ordinary shuriken.  
What makes this actually useful is the sheer number of shuriken that can be replicated with minimal exertion from the shinobi using it; for truly skilled ninja, it can easily reach into the hundreds.

Chakra: (Special) \+ X/10  
Damage: (Special)  
Range: 5 \+ STR/4  
Area: X  
Speed: (Special)  
Seal Speed: 16

Effects:  
One shuriken must be thrown each time this jutsu is used. X additional shuriken are created in mid-flight, and vanish after this technique is resolved. X has a maximum value of your CHA.  
Two things must be determined: the attack's strength, and its number of targets.  
You may direct up to (DEX+CHA)/12 shuriken at any single target. Its Speed and Damage are determined following the normal rules for multi-throws. Determine what a normal Stamina cost would be for a multi-throw using that many shuriken; that becomes the "Special" portion of Shuriken Shadow Clone's Chakra cost.  
You may attack any number of targets that way, using up to a maximum of X+1 shuriken. This is selective, meaning you may choose to hit or ignore people as you wish within the targeted area. Area-of-Effect dodge penalties do apply normally, however.  
This is treated as a ranged taijutsu multi-throw using shuriken, and does receive the normal \+2 Accuracy from shuriken. No matter how many people are targeted, this is treated as a single attack, with one Accuracy and one damage roll.  
Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique cannot be used with poisoned weapons.

technique. If it fails, it applies a Stun 10\.  
Once someone is trapped, seals can be applied to the Cloth Bind, with varying effects. Any Accuracy penalties normally associated with these techniques do not apply; instead, they receive a \+6 Accuracy bonus. Note that these seals are applied to the cloth bind itself, not the individual (and as such, escaping would end all the effects)--indeed, it is impossible to apply seals to someone trapped inside Cloth Binding, as the cloth disrupts the delicate chakra frameworks needed.

*Five Elements Seal:*  
The victim cannot spend Chakra in any way, and all Upkeeps they have (including Upkeep 0\) end immediately and cannot be reestablished.

*Sacred Silence Seal:*  
The target becomes unable to produce noise; any sounds they would make are muted (even without their mouth being covered). Additionally, their chakra, and that of the cloth bind, cannot be seen or sensed (by doujutsu, chakra sensors, or natural chakra). If they have any of those senses, they are similarly disabled.

*Influence Seal:*  
It is impossible for the victim to perform any sort of taijutsu.

*Evil Sealing Method:*  
If the Upkeep used to pay for the technique is ended, the person who originally paid it has 20 IC to resume the Upkeep (a Speed 10 action) before the Cloth Bind's effects ends; if they do so, the cloth bind remains intact and functioning normally.

If all four of those seals are applied, the cloth bind no longer has an upkeep and becomes effectively permanent. At this point it is also possible for someone who knows Nemurihane (the B-rank Genjutsu) to apply a Rune-Inscribing Technique to the Cloth Bind. This will allow the victim to be placed in, and woken from, a state of suspended animation at will.  
A total of 1000 or more damage will destroy the cloth bind, freeing the trapped individual; the cloth takes damage from anything targeting them before they do. It is also impossible to target the victim with medical ninjutsu or genjutsu while they are still trapped inside the cloth. If the user puts a strengthening seal on the cloth, then it effectively becomes indestructible, which means there is no hope for the trapped individual to ever escape.  
The victim can be freed by anyone able to remain in melee, as a Speed 20 Delay 20 action. After the cloth bind has been escaped (by any means), all seals on it dissipate and the cloth itself becomes useless.

# **Doton**

[|E-Ranks|](#doton-e-rank)
[|D-Ranks|](#doton-d-rank)
[|C-Ranks|](#doton-c-rank)
[|B-Ranks|](#doton-b-rank)
[|A-Ranks|](#doton-a-rank)

## **Doton E-ranks** 

### **Ganseki Tsuppari \- Rock Thrust**

Often stomping beforehand, you then motion forward and either shoot a narrow column or spike at your opponent, or a rock of decent size. Whichever way, this is the weakest of any Doton.

Chakra: 8  
Damage: 8d6  
Range: 6  
Speed: 8 
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Attack, Blunt, Projectile

### **Mimizu no Jutsu \- Earthworm Technique**

Sending a tiny rumble through the earth ahead of you, you cause the area around your opponents to explosively sprout spikes from the ground into their ankles and shins\! It's rather painful and good for catching a small group of opponents.

Chakra: 8  
Damage: 4d4  
Range: 10  
Radius: 8  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Attack, AoE, Environmental, Ground-Based

Effects:  
Dodging this technique allows people to avoid its initial damage, but they are still inside the field of rock spikes. Anyone inside the affected area moving by any means other than the Move action, takes 1d4+NDB\*(Yards move inside the Area) Piercing Damage.

### **Monosugai no Jutsu \- Earth Shaping Technique**

You inject your own chakra through your hands into a natural surface to allow it's texture to become more like mud or clay as your fingers sink into it. This can be used to all sorts of ends. Making a statue, digging a hole, climbing a wall, whatever you want\! ...As long as it has to do with rocks and stuff.

Chakra: 10  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 4

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based

Effects: You can shape the surface of a rock, or mold it in your hands like clay. If you use this before climbing an earthen surface (be it a cliff face or a castle wall) you gain a \+5 bonus to Athletics checks associated with climbing it, by making hand- and footholds (for yourself only). This doesn't work if you're, say, climbing up the side of a cliff face using a rope. I really shouldn't have needed to say that, but, yanno.

### **Yurokensei \- Tremorsense**

Often placing a hand to the ground after the seals to feel the vibrations, this technique helps you find nearby creatures and enemies. Most importantly, enemies\! Their steps, no matter how quiet, can be sensed by you from a great distance\!  
Chakra: 10  
Speed: 10  
Range: 10 \+ Chakra Control skill  
Seal Speed: 6

Tag: Utility, Self, Ground-Based

Effects:  
You can perform a free Search Action against anyone touching the ground or any rock surface (including worked stone, such as brick walls or tiled flooring. As well as those underground), using your Chakra Control Skill in place of your Awareness.

Anyone not hiding is located automatically; if you find someone you know exactly where they are the moment you use this (If you beat their TN, this will break their stealth), but do not retain 'sight' of them. This notably cannot be used for the Observe Action against Clones and, in fact, means you cannot use Observe if Tremorsense is your only way of perceiving your opponent.

### **Doton: Shindou \- Earth Release: Tremor**

Extra earth-elemental chakra is infused another Doton technique. When the technique hits the ground, or somebody touching the ground, it causes the earth itself to shake violently in that exact spot. The property damage potential's pretty impressive, but nothing compared to serious offensive jutsu.

Chakra: \+5, \+1 per rank above E  
Speed: \+2  
Seal Speed: \+3

Tag: Attack, Link, AOE, Ground-Based

Effects:  
This technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Doton jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The technique has a radius of 3 yards, \+3 yards per rank above E.  
Within this area, the shaking ground imposes a Stun 3, \+1 per rank the jutsu Shindou was used with is above E; if the technique Shindou was used with already inflicts a Stun, that Stun is increased by the jutsu's rank (instead of Shindou's normal effect). Anyone not targeted by the original attack must dodge Shindou, in which case the original technique's Accuracy bonuses or penalties are ignored.  
This can be used on its own as Chakra 8, Speed 6, and Seal Speed 6\. In this case it's Radius 10, Stun 5, centered on (but not affecting) yourself. It does also require a Defense roll in this case.

## **Doton D-rank**

### **Doki Kantsuu no Jutsu \- Earthen Skewer Technique**

Rock Thrust, except actually meant to do serious harm to people outside of training matches. You summon a spike of earth actually capable of skewering an enemy\! This can also be more of a solid hit, not as pointy, as to whatever degree they want, and can even look like a fist or some similar, stylized attack, but it's still just big rocks coming at you.

Chakra: 16  
Damage: 12d8\*1.25  
Range: 12   
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 12
Special: Stun 4 

Tags: Attack, Piercing, Ground-Based

Effects:  
This technique has +10% wounding.

### **Tama no Nendo \- Clay Bullet**

Pushing your chakra into the ground beneath you, you pull up a ball of earth and mud, globby and chakra filled that you then launch or literally throw sometimes at the opponent. Once on them, the mud is held semi-cohesive by the chakra lacing it, which can restrict the victim's movement.

Chakra: 13  
Damage: 5d10\*1.25  
Range: 6  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 10
Accuracy: \+2
Special: Immobilization 3, This technique receives only half your damage bonus.

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

Effects: The Immobilization penalty fades by 1 every 15 initiative counts. Someone affected by this mud may make a 1d20\+STR/5 (theirs) vs. 1d20\+CHA/5 (yours) check to break free. This is a Speed 5 action; for every point they succeed by, the penalty is reduced by 1. For every 5 points they succeed by, the action's Speed is reduced by 5 (potentially all the way down to 0). If you hit someone with this technique while they are still suffering from the Immobilization of a previous application, you do not reapply the penalty but extend its current penalty another 10 IC.

### **Iwa Funsai Buin \- Rock Smashing Staff**

You hold out your hands or similarly grab some nearby rock and create a large, blunt object from it\! This is often a hammer or staff, but also could be stylized however you see fit. As we all know, getting hit with rocks hurts, so this is rather painful.

Chakra: 12  
Upkeep: 1  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Utility, Self, Creation

Effects:  
You acquire a Club from the standard Club options in the Equipment section. You may then upgrade it using Artisan points equal to your Chakra Control \- 5. You may choose to double the Base Speed and Upkeep of this Technique to create a second Club in your other hand during the activation of this Technique. Both weapons gain the dual property (for free) but the artisan points must be split between the 2 weapons.
When using it, you add a Stun 4 (or increase its existing Stun by 3) effect to it.This Club lasts until you let go of it or end this Technique’s Upkeep. You may perform Handseals while holding Earth Clubs, but doing so increases the Seal Speed by 4 for one Club, and 6 for two Clubs.


### **Shinjuu Zanshu no Jutsu \- Double Suicide Decapitation Technique**

After thoroughly concealing yourself, this technique allows you to move through the ground for a short amount of time, long enough to position yourself under the enemy and pull them down under the ground.

Chakra: 14  
Range: 8  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Attack, Melee, Ground-Based

Effects: This technique can only be used from stealth or underground, and uses your melee Taijutsu accuracy (rather than Ninjutsu). If you hit, you inflict them with a -1 Immobilization Penalty per point your Accuracy beats their defense, to a maximum of -6. They can dig themselves out from underground as a Speed 10 action which removes the penalty entirely. Until they get rid of the Immobilization penalty from this technique they can not move (as they are stuck to the spot), but can otherwise attack and defend themselves.

### **Doro Bunshin no Jutsu \- Mud Clone Technique**

An advanced variation of Bunshin no Jutsu, this jutsu creates solid clones made from the earth beneath a shinobi's feet, which change their appearance to look like the user. They have many advantages over normal clones, but are significantly more difficult to create.

Chakra: 12, \+4\*X  
Speed: 6, \+1\*X  
Seal Speed: 4, \+2\*X  
Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu

Tags: Utility, Clone

Effects:  
You create X clones. These follow all the rules for regular bunshin (limitations of 3, etc), with the following exceptions.

If someone strikes a mud clone with an unarmed attack, they suffer a \-4 immobilization penalty, reduced by 1 every 10 IC. If they attack with a melee weapon, they roll 1d20\+STR/10 against your 1d20\+CHA/8; if they fail, the weapon is stuck in the clone (which is exposed as a clone), and retrieving it is a Speed 5 action that allows another check to pull it free with a \+2 bonus for each previous attempt.

Against ranged attacks, mud clones can take 50 points of damage before being destroyed (and revealed as clones).

### **Jishin Shushou \- Earth Shaking Palm**

Harnessing a large amount of chakra into the palm of your hand, you then slam it down into the ground in front of you to blast rocks and debris up to distract your opponents, allowing you to quickly escape their field of view or capitalize on the momentary distraction.

Chakra: 13  
Radius: 10  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 8
Special: Stun 5

Tags: Attack, Utility, AoE, Ground-Based

Effects:  
You may immediately Hide as part of this technique.

### **Doton: Nebaneba Shita Karada \- Earth Style: Sticky Body Technique**

Using the dirt around you to create a mud like substance around your torso, your arms, and your chest. It acts as a powerful medium and can be activated with chakra in order to cause people to stick to you.

Chakra: 8  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 5  
Requires: 10 Chakra Control

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based, Self

Effects  
This gives you a \+3 bonus to all your grapple rolls whilst either pinning an opponent, or being pinned by one.

## **Doton C-rank**

### **Retsudotensho \- Split Earth Turn Around Palm**

This technique causes the ground surrounding the enemy to spiral inwards on itself, burying them alive or crushing them. This technique is capable of causing quite a bit of damage to the area. This technique is much more damaging if used in rocky mountainous areas, or inside a cave.

Chakra: 25  
Damage: 12d12\*1.4  
Range: 25  
Area: 12   
Speed: 22  
Seal Speed: 15
Special: Immobility 6

Tags: Attack, AoE, Blunt, Ground-Based

Effects:  
The immobilization penalty lasts until the victim leaves the entire affected area, as they fall into the destroyed section of ground.

### **Doryuu Taiga \- Earth Flow River**

You cause a long stretch of nearby ground to become mud and slide your opponents down a torrenting river of rocks and dirt, spewing them out at the end. This often leaves people hurt, and disoriented\!

Chakra: 18
Damage: 25d6  
Line: 10, 20  
Speed: 18  
Seal Speed: 14

Tags: Attack, AoE, Blunt, Ground-Based

Effects:  
This moves anyone hit by it CHA/8\+5 Yards all in the direction the river 'flows' (chosen by the line). Everyone receives a Stun equal to how far they move \-5; the stun is divided by 3 if they block.  
If this is blocked by an effect which halts its progress (such as Earth Shore Return), nobody behind that effect is affected.

### **Doroku Gaeshi \- Earth Shore Return**

Slamming both hands into the ground, the user can cause a large rectangle wall of earth to pop up in front up them, covering whatever attack someone may be directing at them.

Chakra: 16, \+6 if destroyed
Range: 16  
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Interrupt, AoE

Effects:  
This creates a wall 4 yards wide and 3 yards high that takes the hit from an attack. This wall absorbs 200 \+ 10\* (Ninjutsu damage bonus) damage. If destroyed, any remaining damage carries on to you (in which case you cannot defend against it further) or whoever else you used this to protect (in which case, they can).

As implied up there, this can be used to protect anyone in range. However, Earth Shore Return can't be used against melee attacks, or ranged attacks originating 5 yards or less away from you. After having all its HP depleted, or at the end of the IC it was used on, the wall crumbles into dirt and gravel.  

This wall takes double damage from Raiton, and half  
damage from Suiton. The Wall is considered to be Blocking for any relevant interactions (such as Fuuma Shuriken).

### **Kaigeki Chite \- Crushing Earth Hand**

You create a huge hand of rock that you can manipulate and wield, in place of your actual hand. Though you have no physical connection to the large hand, your chakra flowing through it is controlled by an intense focus on your right hand. Or left hand, if that's your main.

Chakra: 20  
Range: 10 \+CHA/2  
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 15

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based

Effects:  
You can use the giant rock hand to use any non grapple E or D rank Taijutsu technique, or simply a basic attack, as long as the ability is one that would utilize your hands. No kicks or clan jutsu allowed\! It may use C rank techniques, but doing so counts as 2 uses. The rock hand is good for only 2 uses, at which point it breaks apart into ordinary rocks unless you pay its Chakra cost again; doing so has no speed or seal speed, but still has its Chakra cost and preserves it for 3 more uses. The hand uses your CHA \+50 as its STR, for the purpose of determining its damage bonus.

### **Doro Nami no Jutsu \- Mud Wave Technique**

Your chakra being applied to your legs, you turn the ground below your feet into mud which you then stand upon, riding the wave at increased speeds as you flow across the battlefield. This is a good mode of transportation, and a good way to enhance an earth attack\!

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 15

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based, Self

Effects:  
You increase your AGI stat for the purposes of movement by CHA/2. You may choose to end this technique at any time, or as part of a D rank or higher damage dealing Doton jutsu. If you end it as part of a jutsu, that technique gains a Stun equal to 2+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)/3, or increases its existing Stun by that much, from absorbing the mud used in this technique.

This is incompatible with effects which increase your normal movement speed--such as the Runner ability, and Racing Thunder Technique. While Mud Wave is active, you do not receive their benefits.

### **Moguragakure no Jutsu \- Hiding Like a Mole Technique**

Channeling your chakra into the ground below you, you turn the dirt or earth or rock into fine sand. It effects your entire body so you simply slide down quickly, but only making a tunnel big enough for one person. After digging your way down, you can sense everything going on above still, and can even cover the hole to make it seem like you never even burrowed away.

Chakra: 18 
Speed: 6
Seal Speed: 12

Tags: Interrupt, Ground-Based

Effects: You dive down a yard underground, but are afflicted with Stun 6\. If used as an Interrupt, this requires a dodge roll with a \+5 bonus; success, even partial, will allow you to trigger the second half of this jutsu.

Next, roll Espionage \+5 vs. Awareness. If you are successful, the opponents can't tell how you left, or that there's a hole in the ground: They think you simply vanished, or died (if used as an interrupt against a sufficiently impressive attack). You are hidden at Stealth 2 against anyone whose Awareness you beat, but cannot move, aside from resurfacing (a simple, Speed 0 action once you can move again). For every time you use this jutsu in the same combat after the first, you take a cumulative \-5 to your Espionage roll. While underground, you have an additional \+5 Stealth and attempts to Track you take a \-5 penalty.

Anyone can attack you while you are under the ground, and any defensive roll you take while submerged takes a \-6 penalty. An attack which deals at least 100 damage will break through the surface of the earth above you, ending your submerged state forcefully, but the actual damage dealt to you will be reduced by half (after seeing if it does enough to break the earth above you). The Damage of Raiton Attacks is doubled before all calculations when targeting you in this manner.

### **Dochuu Eigyo no Jutsu \- Moving Underground as if Swimming Technique**

This technique reduces the consistency of earth into less than that of fine sand by channeling chakra into it, allowing the user to dig through it with ease. This affects the entire body, and the earth returns to its normal consistency after they've passed.

Chakra: 14
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6

Tags: Utility, Self, Ground-Based

Effects: This may only be used while underground, such as from the effects of Moguragakure no Jutsu, to burrow through solid rock, and can be used while Stealthed without revealing you. While you maintain this technique's upkeep, you can move underground up to a yard deep (any deeper any you would begin to be crushed by the pressure of the earth around you), using CHA/2 in place of AGI for determining your movement speed.

Anyone can attack you while you are under the ground, and any defensive roll you take while submerged takes a \-6 penalty. An attack which deals at least 100 damage will break through the surface of the earth above you, ending this jutsu forcibly, but the actual damage dealt to you will be reduced by half (after seeing if it does enough to break the earth above you). The Damage of Raiton Attacks is doubled before all calculations when targeting you in this manner.

## **Doton B-rank**

### **Doton: Doryou Dango \- Earth Release: Earth Mausoleum Dumpling**

Channelling chakra into your arms and the ground below you, you place your hands on the earth and lift up an incredibly large (no, really, just look at the Area on this thing\!) ball of earth and rock, which is then thrown at your enemies.

Chakra: 38
Damage: 18d20\*1.5  
Range: 50  
Area: 40  
Speed: 24, Delay 10  
Seal Speed: 30
Special: Stun 12

Tags: Attack, AoE, Blunt

### **Doryuukatsu \- Earth Flow Divide**

Flowing your energy into special underground 'Dragon Veins' (that means chakra leylines, not a literal dragon's body--I'm talking to you, Takuto) you can literally make a tear in the earth, and create a large chasms. This is most often used as a way of breaking through a large wall, destroying an enemy camp or other barricades and such.

Chakra: 35  
Damage: 80d6  
Line: 5, Up to Chakra Control Yards  
Speed: 24  
Seal Speed: 18

Tags: Attack, Blunt, AoE, Ground-Based

Effects:  
Any damage from this technique is tripled against an inanimate, stationary object.

### **Doton: Dorou Domu Kekkai \- Earth Release: Earth Prison Dome of Magnificient Nothingness**

This creates a dome chamber around a small group of enemies, which you enlace in your own chakra to make it extra hard to escape.

Chakra: 32  
Area: 20  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 14

Tags: AoE, Environmental, Ground-Based, On-Contact

Effects:  
This creates a dome of earth directly in front of you, with you at the edge of its radius. Anyone who cannot dodge is trapped inside the dome. The dome has 400 \+ (damage bonus)\*10 HP.

Every 5 IC which pass, the following effects occur:  
Everyone inside the dome has their Chakra penalty increased by 1\.  
You have your Chakra penalty reduced by 1 per person inside the dome.  
The dome regains (damage bonus)\*5 HP, up to its maximum.  
You must keep one hand on the dome at all times; if you break contact the above effects end (and cannot be reestablished), but the dome retains any HP it had at that point.

### **Doryuu Jouheki \- Earth Flow Rampart**

Feeding your chakra into the ground you cause the earth to rise under your feet into a large rampart. The shape of the rampart can be anything from level ground to a steep, needle like mountain, and it is mostly used for walling something off, slowing down pursuers, or reaching that jar off the top shelf that is always so hard to reach.

Chakra: X  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 20

Tags: Utility, Environmental

Effects:  
Create what is basically a huge wall\! It can be up to the following dimensions: Length \= X, Width \= X/4, Height \= X/2. If you use this and X is 30 or more, the area you are in counts as rocky terrain for the purposes of jutsu requirements.

### **Doton: Iwagakure no Jutsu \- Earth Release: Hidden Among Rocks Technique**

This technique allows you to blend into rocks and remain hidden. Even the texture of your body takes on that of the stones, and it's quite possible (indeed, more than a few experienced jounin have embarrassing sories about it) to have an enemy physically sit on you without realizing you're there.

Chakra: 32  
Upkeep: 12  
Speed: 22  
Seal Speed: 28

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based

Effects:  
This allows you to enter level 3 Stealth, and gives a \+10 bonus to your stealth checks while it's maintained. However, it requires rocky terrain (such as the inside of a cave, a mountain path, the debris from a destroyed wall, or a large boulder), and you cannot move more (blinking and breathing are okay) while it's maintained.

### **Doton: Domu \- Earth Release: Iron Skin**

You direct chakra to flow through the skin over all portions of your body, increasing your body's defensive power to its utmost limit. This causes your skin to darken in response to the earth-elemented chakra, taking on a dull gray-brown, almost black color. This hardening also empowers your physical attacks, making this a useful, if draining, all-purpose technique.

Chakra: 27  
Upkeep: 10  
Speed: 16  
Seal Speed: 17

Tags: Utility, Self, Ground-Based

Effects:  
You gain CHA/3 Damage Reduction, and increase your Physical Damage Bonus by that amount /10. Raiton bypasses all this technique’s effects.

### **Doryuuheki \- Earth Style Wall**

The most powerful direct Doton-based defense, the user either manipulates the surrounding terrain or generates (using chakra\!) and spits out an prodigious amount of flowing earth which forms a wall and solidifies. Either way, this creates a barrier coated with chakra that will stop most attacks totally.

Chakra: 34  
Special: Interrupt  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 24

Tags: Defensive, Ground-Based

Effects:  
You create a wall of earth that blocks up to (50 \+ (ninjutsu damage bonus)\*10 )\*(Speed) damage. It takes 50% extra damage from Raiton, but only half damage from Suiton and Katon.

You may use Action Points to reduce Doryuuheki's (base) Seal Speed, on a 1:1 basis, to as low as 12\. Note that if you are able to use Doryuuheki as an interrupt, you may do so without the need for a roll. Earth Style Wall can only be used against attacks which originated more than 5 yards away from you.  
Used against area-of-effect attacks, this may protect multiple people, as long as they can all be placed behind the same 15 yard long line.

### **Iwa Bunshin \- Rock Clone**

You either gather animate rocks from you, or actually generate them with chakra and regurgitate a stream of stones (somehow, you're protected from a cut esophagus or chipped teeth during this process). Either way, the rocks then take on a human shape and appearance.

Chakra: 10, \+6\*X  
Speed: 10, \+2\*X  
Seal Speed: 10, \+3\*X  
Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu

Tags: Utility, Clone

Effects:  
You may create up to 3 clones that can look like yourself or anyone else present. If they look like someone else, that person may then hide amongst your clones to receive the normal benefits of having clones; these can even be added to their own clones.  
Rock clones can take 100+(your ninjutsu damage bonus)\*5 points of damage before being destroyed, or exposed as clones, and take only half damage from AoE attacks. Rock clones use your attributes, even if they're imitating someone else. They may take the following actions:

\[1 AP\] Dodge: Usable if the clone needs to defend itself.  
\[4 AP\] Attack: The clone may perform a basic unarmed attack. This does benefit from Power Attack or Unarmed Focus, if you have those abilities, but the clone does not need to make a Stamina roll.  
\[X AP\] Move: Every 3 Speed of the Move action costs 1 AP.

When Rock Clones attack they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.

### **Doryu Ken \- Earth Style Fist**

By surrounding your arm or leg in a coat of solidified earth, you can attack an opponent while being protected from direct contact with them.

Chakra: 17  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 15

Tags: Utility, Self

Effects:  
So long as this technique is maintained, your taijutsu attacks are enhanced. You suffer no 'on-contact' effects (such as damage from punching a foe covered in spikes) from performing unarmed attacks. Additionally, unarmed parries cannot be used against your attacks.

## **Doton A-rank**

### **Doryuudan \- Earth Dragon Blast**

A dragon-like head of rock, mud, and dirt rises up from the gound, its maw wide open. From said maw, it launches dozens of high-velocity projectiles of dense, chakra-infused earth\! While not as visually impressive as some techniques, Doryuudan is incredibly demanding upon its user--and incredibly devastating to its victims.

Chakra: 50  
Damage: 28d20\*2 
Range: 60 
Speed: 40  
Seal Speed: 30
Special: Stun 20

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

Effects:  
Blocking reduces this technique's damage by only 25%.

### **Iwa Renda no Jutsu \- Rock Barrage Technique**

After performing the necessary seals, the user channels chakra into the rocks and stone around them. Their chakra causes large rocks to shatter into smaller ones, which are then launched as high-velocity projectiles towards potentially dozens of targets.

Chakra: 48  
Damage: (5\*X)d20  
Accuracy: \+X/5  
Range: 7 \* (ninjutsu damage bonus)  
Speed: 30  
Seal Speed: 26

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

Effects:  
You fire up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) projectiles. You may target the same person multiple times with X being the number of projectiles at a single target.

### **Doton: Sando no Jutsu \- Earth Release: Mountain Earth Technique**

The user creates two monolithic walls up from the ground, destroying the environment for several hundred yards in either direction, and sends them at one another. As they approach each other, their momentum builds, starting off slow and ending with a collision that removes the third dimension from anything unlucky enough to be caught between them.

Chakra: 50  
Damage: 100d6\*2  
Accuracy: \-10  
Range: 100  
Area: 80  
Speed: 30, Delay 30  
Seal Speed: 26

Tags: Attack, Blunt, AoE

Effects:  
This technique's damage is doubled for determining if it inflicts wounds. If (Heh, “If”) it does cause a wound, it also causes two wounds of the next lower severity, three of the severity below that, and so forth. And it applies them to all body parts.  
Thus, if it inflicted a Critical Wound, it would also inflict two Severes, three Majors, and four Minors. You may reduce Sando's speed below its Delay.

### **Doton: Chidoukaku \- Earth Release: Moving Earth Core**

The user lowers or raises the ground in the surrounding area at high speed, creating giant depressions or spires. Despite how this might seem, it's fairly harmless to the surrounding area. People, plants, and buildings on the affected area will be largely undisturbed. The sides of the hole or spire are quite sturdy, and it's not in danger of collapsing on its own.

Chakra: 30+X  
Speed: 28  
Seal Speed: 30

Tags: Utility, Defensive

Effects:  
This affects everything in a square of up to 50 yards on a side, centered on its user. It moves the ground in that area X\*(damage bonus) yards straight up, or straight down. If you manage to use this as an interrupt, this will allow you to avoid a technique if you move yourself out of its range.

## Wind (Fuuton)
Blocking reduces the damage of Wind techniques by only 25%.
Using a fan you can rapidly manipulate wind and infuse it with chakra on any technique with the fan tag. This removes the seal speed and adds a Stamina roll with a difficulty of 5 \+ 2 \* (the difference between your sealing and the seal speed), made at the same time as the normal Chakra roll. While dual-wielding you only use half your ninjutsu seal speed for the above calculation.

Oh and if there’s no air or any gasses around (Even water has air in it), then you can’t use Fuuton, but… If you’re in a situation like that then you probably have bigger problems to worry about.


## **Fuuton E-ranks**

### **Fuusajin no Jutsu \- Dust Wind Technique**

You use a burst of wind to blow dust, dirt, or other loose particles up into the air, producing an irritating cloud that briefly obscures the visions of people caught inside of it.

Chakra: 6
Accuracy: \+2
Line: 4 x 10 
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Attack, AoE, Fan

Effects:  
Anyone hit suffers \-4 visibility for the next 10 IC.

### **Soujikaze no Jutsu \- Cleansing Wind Technique**

The basic "manipulate the surrounding air to do what you want" technique, leading into many more powerful jutsu that operate on the same premise. It's still useful, for a sufficiently resourceful ninja.

Chakra: 7  
Range: 20  
Radius: 20  
Speed: 4  
Seal Speed: 7

Tags: Utility, AoE, Fan

Effects:  
This reduces any existing visibility penalties resulting from smoke, mist, clouds of dust, or the like, by 4\. Repeated use of this jutsu will reduce them further, potentially eliminating them entirely.

## **Fuuton D-ranks**

### **Fuuton: Kazekiri \- Wind Release: Wind Cutter**

The user generates a narrow arc of wind and chakra, which is sent out to cut things like ropes, lines, and people.

Chakra: 11  
Damage: 4d4\*5  
Range: 20  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 12

Tags: Slashing, Projectile

Effects:  
This technique's damage is considered 75% higher for determining whether or not it inflicts wounds.

### **Fuuton: Fuuma Shuriken no Jutsu \- Wind Shuriken**

You gather the wind in your hands into the shape of a ranged weapon, plating it with your chakra to be hard as iron and sharp as steel. Scholars still argue to this day whether the popular ranged taijutsu weapon was named after this technique, or this technique was named after the popular ranged taijutsu weapon.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 1  
Speed: 5  
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Utility, Creation

Effects:

You create a Fuuma, or up to as many small Ranged weapons (Kunai, Senbon, Shuriken) as you could throw in a multithrow, with stats as per the Equipment section of the PHB. These items gain double their normal thrown range. These weapons have a 20% bonus to wounding if they would otherwise not have a bonus to wounding normally (melee fuuma, shuriken, Kunai) Though these disappear when thrown, if your very next non-interrupt action is to use this Jutsu again after throwing them, your SS is 0 (but not removed), and the Spd of the jutsu is 0\.

### **Fuuton: Hineri Dangan \- Wind Release: Twister Shot**

Holding their hand half-grasped, the user blows a constant stream of wind into their hand which begins to spiral around in a ball or small tornado shape. The tornado is then sent out toward the target as the hand is opened.

Chakra: 14  
Damage: 4d4\*7  
Range: 10  
Speed: 11  
Seal Speed: 13

Tags: Slashing, Projectile

### **Fuuton: Shikisetsufuu Shou \- Wind Release: Four Seasonal Winds Palm**

In a fashion similar to how ninja knead chakra into their palms and feet to stick to walls and ceilings, you gather wind elemental chakra, but project and hold it just beyond your body to supplement your unarmed strikes.

Chakra: 10  
Upkeep: 4    
Speed: 2  
Seal Speed: 12  
Requires: Chakra Control 7

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
While this technique's upkeep is maintained, all your unarmed taijutsu techniques are blocked as if they were fuuton jutsu (meaning, in most cases, that blocking reduces the damage by only 25%, instead of 50%).

### **Hagitoru Aori no Jutsu \- Tearing Gust Technique**

Generally performed with a fan as a matter of practicality, this technique unleashes a burst of wind that will not only deflect projectiles, but also strip them of any chakra they may be infused with.

Chakra: 11  
Speed: 4  
Seal Speed: 12

Tags: Interrupt, Fan

Effects:  
You attempt to parry an incoming ranged taijutsu attack. Even if you fail, any ninjutsu effects on it (such as Housenka) are removed.

### **Rakuyou Buyou \- Falling Leaves Dance**

Using the wind, you kick up any light debris in the area (leaves in a forest, sand in a desert, conveniently ubiquitous scraps of paper in a town) to swirl around you just long enough for you to make a sneaky, ninja-fast getaway.

Chakra: 10  
Speed: 7
Seal Speed: 9

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
You Hide, with a \+5 bonus.

### **Fuuton Nagare \- Wind Release Stream**

By blowing air from your mouth, you can change direction in mid-air. This allows you to control where you land when falling (avoiding the sharp rocks when you jump off a waterfall, that kind of thing) and may be useful for avoiding mid-air hazards.

Chakra: 12  
Speed: 2  
Seal Speed: 7

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
This can also be used when falling from any height, to slow yourself sufficiently to avoid being harmed by the impact from hitting the ground. Also whenever you make a grapple roll, you can use this technique to give you \+3.

### **Fuuton: Taikyaku Haretsu \- Wind Release: Bursting Retreat**

You take in a deep breath, then exhale a mixture of air and chakra with enough speed and force to augment a backwards leap, allowing you to hastily escape... well, whatever manner of unpleasantness you felt the need to get away from.

Chakra: 8+X  
Speed: \+X  
Seal Speed: 6

Tags: Link

Effects:  
This technique is used alongside a Dodge interrupt and increases the yards you can move (for determining AoE penalties) by X.

### **Fuuton: Kaze no Senpūki \- Wind Release: Fan of Wind**

You form your wind condensing it around your hand. Not exactly a fan but this serves a similar function to one being able to reduce fuuton seal speeds and act as a fan for all intents and purposes.

Chakra: 12
Upkeep: 1
Speed: 8
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Utility, Self, Creation

Effects:  
You acquire a Fan from the standard Fan options in the Equipment section. You may then upgrade it using Artisan points equal to your Chakra Control \- 5. You may choose to double the Base Speed and Upkeep of this Technique to create a second Fan in your other hand during the activation of this Technique. Both weapons gain the dual property (for free) but the artisan points must be split between the 2 weapons.

When using it, your weapon gains a \+25% Wounding Bonus and Fuuton jutsu cast with it have their seal speeds reduced to 0. This Fan lasts until you let go of it or end this Technique’s Upkeep. You may perform Handseals while holding Wind Fans, but doing so increases the Seal Speed by 4 for one Fan, and 6 for two Fans.

## **Fuuton C-rank**

### **Kamaitachi no Jutsu \- Sickle Wind Technique**

This technique allows you to create and manipulate many small air currents and vacuum pockets in the form of a whirling gale, which is directed at an opponent before it dissipates. This produces injuries that resemble what one would expect to see from dozens of blades.

Chakra: 19
Damage: 4d8\*5  
Range: 25  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 18

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Slashing, Fan

Effects:  
This technique's damage is considered 100% higher for the purpose of causing wounds.

### **Fuuton: Shinkuuha \- Wind Release: Vacuum Wave**

The user takes in a deep breath an spins while exhaling, forming several rotating blades of wind that cover a substantial area around them, slicing through multiple foes at once while leaving allies unharmed

Chakra: 24
Damage: 5d6\*6  
Area: 15 
Speed: 16  
Seal Speed: 20

Tags: Slashing, AoE, Projectile

Effects:  
This technique may differentiate between enemies and allies within its area of effect. It ignores armor, and has \+25% wounding.

### **Fuuton: Daitoppa \- Wind Release: Great Breakthrough**

A relatively simple technique which creates a sudden gust of wind. Its actual force varies wildly based upon the strength of the user. A superior shinobi will produce alarmingly destructive results, while a weaker one would be better off finding other methods to attack.

Chakra: 20  
Damage: 6d4\*5  
Range: Damage Bonus
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 12

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

Effects:  
This uses double the user's normal ninjutsu damage bonus and knocks the victim back a number of yards equal to half the range.

### **Kazekame Kaigara no Jutsu \- Wind Turtle's Shell Technique**

The technique creates a rotating dome of wind around the user, chakra-infused air moving quickly enough to blur the image of the person inside, and deflect many incoming attacks. However, the technique is a far cry from being a true absolute defense.

Chakra: 14 \+ (X \* 3)    
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Interrupt

Effects:  
This may be used to parry any ranged attack. X is 1 per the technique’s rank above D.

Against Raiton and ranged taijutsu attacks, you receive a +6 bonus to your Accuracy rolls. And even if they hit, the effect of partial defense is doubled (the attack deals only 10% damage per point it hits by). 
Against nonKaton projectile ninjutsu, your bonus is instead \+4. For all others, you receive no bonus.

Against Katon: If a technique bypasses Wind Turtle's Shell you receive no benefit from partial defense, and the technique has its damage (against you) increased by 25%.

### **Tobu Choyaku no Jutsu \- Vaulting Leap Technique**

After performing the seals for this jutsu you amass chakra in your feet, then expel it to generate a powerful burst of wind while kicking off the ground with a power leap. To the inexperienced, the results look almost like flight.

Chakra: 14 \+ X/2
Speed: 10 \+ X \* 2, Delay X \* 2
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
This technique's gains/increases its Stamina cost by 10 for each time you’ve used it in a fight. Y is its (Stamina / 10)
When you activate this technique you can jump X / 2 \+ (STR / 10 \- Y \* 2)) \* Ndb. X has a maximum value of 10 and a minimum of 0.
If you are suffering from an Immobilization penalty, the distance you're able to travel with Vaulting Leap is reduced by 5% per point of Immobilization.


## **Fuuton B-rank**

### **Daikamaitachi no Jutsu \- Great Sickle Wind Technique**

The user of this technique releases a powerful burst of wind, chakra concentrating the air into several layered air streams. This creates pockets of both vacuums and high-speed air which have enough focused force behind them to cut down trees.

Chakra: 28  
Damage: 10d8\*5  
Range: 25  
Speed: 10
Seal Speed: 24

Tags: Attack, Interrupt, Projectile, Slashing, Fan

Effects:  
This can be used as an attack or a defensive against a ranged taijutsu attack:

As an Interrupt, you parry the incoming attack with a +2 bonus. If you successfully defend, Great Sickle Wind Technique immediately acts as an attack at no extra cost, using the results of your parry roll as its Accuracy and its speed for both damage and legal defenses from the opponent is equal to what it was when used as a defense.

### **Shinkuu Enzan \- Decapitating Vacuum Disc**

As devastating as it is impractical, this technique earned its name for a reason. After forming the many, many handseals involved, you draw a shuriken (or one of its larger brethren) and use it to center a disc of wind chakra. When you throw the weapon, its rotation is passed onto the chakra, forming a several-foot-wide blade rotating at incredible speed.  
Great for spars and parties\!

Chakra: 42  
Damage: Weapon's damage, \+ Ndb dice  
Range: As thrown weapon, \+Ndb \* 2 yards  
Speed: 16 \+ (weapon's Speed)  
Seal Speed: 40

Tags: Slashing, Projectile

Effects:  
You throw a single thrown weapon. Add your physical and ninjutsu damage bonuses together; this is your damage bonus for Shinkuu Enzan. For calculating wounds, consider Shinkuu Enzan's damage to be 100% higher.

Although this technique uses a thrown weapon as part of it, it is a Fuuton ninjutsu technique, not a thrown weapon technique; Weapon Focus and similar benefits (such as a Fuuma Shuriken's increased damage based on how much it hits by) do not apply to Shinkuu Enzan, nor do defenses specifically targeting thrown weapons.


### **Fuuton: Shinkuugyoku \- Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere**

The user exhales their breath as several small blasts of wind chakra, each not much larger than a marble but traveling at extreme speeds and possessing incredible penetrating power. Their small size can make them difficult to land a strong blow with, which is compensated for by dispersing them over a significant range.

Chakra: 36
Damage: 6d8\*8  
Range: 30
Line: 2, 10
Special: A fan may not be used to remove this technique's Seal Speed.  
Speed: 18  
Seal Speed: 16

Tags: Attack, AoE, Piercing

Effects:  
The effects of partial defense are doubled against this technique: for every point it hits by, it deals only 10% of its full damage. However, it gains \+100% wounding. If someone Takes the Hit for Shinkuugyoku, whoever they were defending will still take 75% damage, so long as the defender received a Major or greater wound.

### **Fuuton: Shinkuu Renpa \- Wind Release: Vacuum Serial Waves**

This technique's user takes a deep breath in, and then exhales several blades of high-sped, chakra-infused wind at varying angles. This technique's power can vary greatly depending on the amount of chakra put into the formation of those wind blades, the number created, and how the user chooses to focus them.

Chakra: 25 \+ 4 \* X  
Damage: (X \* 2)d10\*5  
Range: 25  
Speed: 22  
Seal Speed: 12 \+ X \* 3

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Slashing

Effects:  
You may target up to X (max of 5) people with Shinkuu Renpa as a single action. While the base damage remains the same no matter how many targets you have, your (ninjutsu damage bonus)*(Shinkuu Renpa's Speed) is divided by the number of targets.

Against ninjutsu-based defenses, Shinkuu Renpa is considered one rank higher, or to deal twice as much damage, as applicable. (For example, a 200 damage Shinkuu Renpa against a 100 damage wall would destroy the wall and still deal 150 damage to whatever was behind it).

### **Fuuton: Fuujin Kokyuu \- Wind Release: Wind God's Breath**

You unleash a wave of chakra converted into gale-force winds, knocking away everyone and everything around you. So long as the winds remain, approaching you is exceedingly difficult. At the same time, those winds will whip any nearby fires into a raging fury.

Chakra: 32  
Upkeep: 8  
Area: 50
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 22

Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental, Fan

Effects:  
Every IC, everyone in the technique's radius is pushed CHA/40 yards away from you, towards its edge. All Raiton and ranged taijutsu attacks within this area have their damage reduced by 25%. However, all Fuuton has \+3 Accuracy, and all Katon does \+15% damage. These effects apply to any jutsu originating inside, passing through or targeting someone within the area.

### **Fuuton: Ama no Yachimata \- Wind Release: Crossroads of Heaven**

One of the more reliable defensive measure Fuuton users are capable of deploying, this creates a sphere of whipping winds around them. Aside from dramatically tossing their hair, causing loose clothes to flap about, and knocking up loose terrain, this makes a sufficiently skilled user virtually impervious to most long-range assaults.

Chakra: 26  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 16

Tags: Utility, Self

Effects:  
The jutsu automatically parries any attack with the projectile tag with a \+5 bonus against raiton and ranged taijutsu. This technique uses your base Accuracy for a B-rank Fuuton, unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. Because it is considered to be the technique parrying incoming attacks, and not you, you cannot modify its accuracy further (such as with Willpower or AP).

Additionally, you get a \+5 bonus to all grapple rolls.

### **Fuuton: Higashikaze no Me \- Wind Release: Eye of the East Wind**

An advanced surveillance technique that, ultimately, falls far short of the efficacy its designers had hoped for. Once activated, it allows the users to view air currents, and, for lack of a better term, 'highlights' inconsistent ones--it's something like visual sonar.  
The idea behind the technique was that this would let its user pinpoint enemies by being able to find their breathing.  
It's not nearly that effective in practice, but does offer some benefits to those willing to adjust to the altered vision it causes.

Chakra: 25  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 22

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
You increase your awareness rolls by your (Chakra Control / 5). Additionally, when targeted by a Surprise or Sneak Attack, you may make an Awareness roll against a Stealth roll from your opponent; if your result is higher, their attack is not considered a Surprise Attack or Sneak Attack.

## **Fuuton A-rank**

### **Kaze no Yaiba \- Blade of Wind**

A rarely-used technique, not because it isn't powerful but because it doesn't appeal to the sorts of shinobi able to learn it. It's a high-powered, taxing, close-ranged wind release technique; most shinobi who prefer close combat will opt for weapons or other elements, and most wind release users prefer to keep their distance. It has seen some limited popular of Sunagakure's ANBU.  
The user emits chakra from their fingertips, forming a virtually invisible "sword" of intense, high-speed winds, which lasts just long enough to make a single attack with. This technique leaves very distinctive wounds, deep slashes with hundreds of miniscule tears at the edges.

Chakra: 35, \+15 if it hits  
Upkeep: 0
Damage: 5d12\*10  
Accuracy: \+4
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 22
Special: This technique receives only half your damage bonus.

Tags: Attack, Melee, Slashing

Effects:  
This technique's damage cannot be blocked, and the effectiveness of an opponent's damage reduction is halved. If this technique hits, it may be used consecutively. If you do so, its Seal Speed is removed, and its Chakra cost is reduced to 35 whether or not it hits. However, each attack increases its Upkeep by 3. Once you release this Upkeep, the blade dissipates.

Kaze no Yaiba gains a \+75% wounding bonus.

### **Okamaitachi no Jutsu \- Scything Wind Technique**

Almost always used with a fan, this technique creates a vast number of heavy air currents and vacuum pockets, varying greatly in speed, width, and angle, with their integrity maintained by chakra. Where they intersect, the crossing currents tear apart anything unfortunate enough to be in their way.  
As effective as this technique is, slicing and smashing anything short of fortified stonework, it can be somewhat unreliable, as there's an element of chance about just how many different ways a victim will be shredded.

Chakra: 36  
Damage: 6d10\*10  
Range: 40  
Speed: 24  
Seal Speed: 42

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Slashing, Fan

Effects:  
This may target any number of people within range, and for the purposes of evading is considered to have an Area equal to its Range. 

Scything Wind gains a +100% wounding bonus.

### **Fuuton: Shinkuu Taigyoku \- Wind Release: Vacuum Great Sphere**

If the Vacuum Sphere technique can be considered a spray of wind-chakra bullets (not that ninja actually know what such things are\!), then the Great Vacuum Sphere is a gigantic wind-chakra cannon ball.  
In terms that ninja actually do understand, this creates a large sphere-shaped vacuum, which is then launched forwards. Anyone who comes in contact with the vacuum is sucked inside, and then either slammed against either the first solid object it encounters or just hit by what amounts to a wall of high-velocity air from every direction as the chakra in the technique dissipates and the technique collapses on them.

Chakra: 46  
Damage: 6d6\*10  
Accuracy: \+2 
Line: 10, 30 
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 28
Special: Stun 15

Tags: Attack, AoE, Blunt, Fan

Effects:  
Shinkuu Taigyoku is unblockable, and enemies do not receive the benefit of partial defense against it. The severity of any wounds it inflicts is increased by one category (minor to major, severe to critical, and so forth) and anyone hit is knocked back to the far end of its range.

### **Fuuton: Kitakaze \- Wind Release: The North Wind**

The north wind wind cleanses the world of its impurities and soothes the raging elements. Once its handseals are completed, a calm but strong wind blows in from the north.

Chakra: 30  
Speed: 22  
Seal Speed: 20

Tags: Utility, AoE

Effects:  
All environmental effects caused by ninjutsu (such as Yomi Numa, or Four Pillar Bind) end immediately, and no such techniques may be activated for double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus worth of IC; however, this cannot end or disperse B- or A-rank Katon techniques. Any Ignite status effects have their severity halved (round down), and any Immobilization with set durations (meaning, ones that fade by a certain amount every so-many IC) are removed, as is any Paralysis that was originally caused by a Raiton technique.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Katon**

## Fire (Katon)

If you ever find yourself completely submerged in water, Katon jutsu won't work. This can be done in any environment with 1k\+ Gallons, but requires a container that can retain that much (like a lake).

## **Katon E-rank**

### **Hinotama no Jutsu \- Fireball Technique**

This jutsu is so weak it's considered a training exercise among academy students who're quick to grasp the basics of katon jutsu. After performing the handseals the user focuses chakra in their hand and projects it into a fist-sized ball of fire, which they can then shoot at a target.

Chakra: 7 
Damage: 5d8!o>8
Range: 10  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 5

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

### **Asayake no Jutsu \- Morning Glow Technique**

In addition to being good practice for chakra control, many fire-using ninja find it useful when left without supplies. It creates a small, warm ball of fire that hovers around its user's palm, over their fingertips, or so forth. This ball is not hot enough to ignite, well, anything, but it's particularly bright for its size.

Chakra: 5  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Utillity

Effects:  
The orb sheds light equivalent to a small oil lamp. This reduces darkness-based visibility effects by 3.

### **Enmaku no Jutsu \- Smokescreen Technique**

A low-level technique which sees some use even by more experienced ninja, in certain situations. It causes a Katon jutsu to release a prodigious amount of smoke before it burns out, reducing visibility over an area.

Chakra: \+3, \+1 per rank above E  
Seal Speed: \+4

Tags: Link, Utility, Environmental

Effects:  
This technique is used in combination with a damage-dealing Katon jutsu, increasing its Seal Speed and Chakra cost accordingly. The technique has a radius of 5 yards, \+5 yards per rank above E. The resulting smokescreen has a duration of 10 IC, \+5 IC per rank above E.

Within this area, the smoke imposes a \-3 visibility penalty, \+1 per rank the jutsu Enmaku was used with is above E. This technique can also be used on its own, using a person suffering from the Ignite status as its source; in this case it's Chakra 6, Speed 5, and Seal Speed 5\. Every 5 points of Ignite is equivalent to one jutsu rank (so "rank D", meaning \-4 visibility, at Ignite 10).

## **Katon D-rank**

### **Katon: Houenka \- Fire Release: Flame Flower**

After completing the handseals, the user creates three balls of fire-elemented chakra: one in each palm, and one in their mouth, all three of which can be fired separately or focused on a single target.

Chakra: 13  
Damage: 6d6!o>6
Range: 15  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 7

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects: This technique hits up to three separate targets. For each fireball beyond the first directed at the same target, the damage they take is increased by 3d6, and the technique has \+1 accuracy.

### **Katon: Shitai Entou \- Fire Release: Flame Tongue**

Originally thought to be a technique that required a prolonged diet of special, possibly chakra-enhanced chemicals, this was later discovered to be actually a fairly simple Katon jutsu. The user breathes out a thick, nearly solid stream of fire from their mouth--typically at another person, whom they would like to injure.

Chakra: 16  
Damage: 12d8!o>7  
Range: 10   
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 8
Special: Burns 3

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

### **Enkounebai no Jutsu \- Sticky Fire Technique**

You spit out a mass of chakra-infused saliva; it's clear, odorless, extremely sticky, very flammable, and kind of gross to get hit by.

Chakra: 8  
Range: 10  
Speed: 7  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Attack, Projectile

Effects:  
Your opponent is covered in the flammable saliva for 30 IC. During so, the first time they are hit by a Katon technique, the saliva ignites, applying an Ignite 5 effect to the unfortunate victim. The severity of this effect is increased by 2 for each rank the jutsu is above E (7 for a D-rank jutsu, 9 for a C-rank, and so forth).

### **Nenshou Yari no Jutsu \- Burning Spear Technique**

This jutsu creates a polearm out of pure flame, which the user can hold unharmed (and without lighting their clothes on fire). Konoha once tried to have a treaty passed to ban the use of this technique, though nobody else quite understands what all the fuss is about.

Chakra: 12  
Upkeep: 1  
Speed: 5  
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Utility, Self, Creation

Effects:  
You acquire a Polearm from the standard Sword options in the Equipment section. You may then upgrade it using Artisan points equal to your Chakra Control \- 5. You may choose to double the Base Speed and Upkeep of this Technique to create a second Sword in your other hand during the activation of this Technique. Both weapons gain the dual property (for free) but the artisan points must be split between the 2 weapons. 

It uses your ninjutsu rather than physical damage bonus. This weapon persists until you let go of it. Whenever someone is struck by your weapon they must pass a status roll or suffer burns equal to half its number of rolled dice. You may form handseals for Katon jutsu while holding this weapon.

### **Katon: Houyoku \- Fire Release: Phoenix Wings**

This technique wreathes part of your body--generally a  
forearm and hand, but it can vary depending on the needs of the technique--with chakra-based flames\! It's quite flashy, and could be considered low-grade nintaijutsu, as it then combined those flames with a physical attack of your choice.

Chakra: 8  
Seal Speed: 7

Tags: Energy, Link, Utility

Effects:  
This technique modifies any non grapple unarmed taijutsu attack. The technique uses your ninjutsu, rather than physical damage bonus, though ignores alterations to the damage bonus (such as doubling, halving, or removing it). If the opponent fails a status roll after being hit by this technique, it inflicts Burns 4\.

### **Ryuuseiu no Jutsu \- Meteor Shower Technique**

The user gathers intense fire chakra in their palms or fingertips before throwing several weapons which ignite in mid-air. Aside from being painful, being hit by flaming bits of metal carries other risks.

Chakra: 9, \+1 per weapon thrown  
Stamina: As multi-throw  
Range: As multi-throw  
Speed: As multi-throw  
Seal Speed: 9
Special: Burns X

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy, Weapon, Multi-throw

Effects:  
X is the number of weapons used in this technique and they are ruined, and cannot be retrieved or reused.

## **Katon C-rank**

### **Housenka no Jutsu \- Phoenix Sage Fire Technique**

After performing the handseals, the user exhales a cluster of small fireballs, each concealing one or more shuriken.

Chakra: 11, \+1 per 2 speed of the multi-throw  
Stamina: As multi-throw  
Damage: \+Xd6  
Range: As multi-throw  
Speed: As multi-throw  
Seal Speed: The speed of the multi-throw.
Special: Burns X/2

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy, Weapon, Multi-throw

Effects:  
X is the number of weapons thrown. This technique benefits from your ninjutsu damage bonus, on top of the normal multi-throw damage bonus. Projectiles used in this technique are rendered unusable afterwards by the intense heat.

### **Goukyaku no Jutsu \- Grand Fireball Technique**

Generations ago, this technique was passed down from father to son within the Uchiha clan as an informal, but sometimes very serious, rite of passage. As time passed its use spread first to other Konoha ninja, and then much further.

Chakra: 20  
Damage: 12d12!o>9  
Range: 30  
Area: 15  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 13
Special: Burns 6

Tags: Attack, AoE, Energy

### **Ryuuka no Jutsu \- Dragon Fire Technique**

This jutsu is painfully slow and inaccurate, making its usefulness situational at best. Most users of the technique find some way to bind or disable their opponents before trying to attack with it. On the other hand, if it manages to connect it can be astonishingly devastating.

Chakra: 25  
Damage: 10d20!o>11  
Accuracy: \-6
Range: 25  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 16  
Special: Burns 8, Ignite 6

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
This technique benefits from double the user's ninjutsu damage bonus.

### **Kasumi Enbu no Jutsu \- Mist Blaze Dance Technique**

Once you perform the handseals, this jutsu allows you to exhale a slightly translucent cloud of potentially flammable gas. Even so much as a spark will spell trouble for anyone unfortunate enough to be within it. As an added effect, the glass is ever-so-slightly toxic.

Chakra: 14
Upkeep: 1
Damage: 10d10!o>(8\-X)
Radius: 20
Range: 20
Speed: 8
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental

Effects:  
This technique initially does no damage. However, it detonates if a Katon jutsu contacts its area, or if a person with an Ignite status of 5 or higher is present. The explosion only deals the listed damage across the area with X being the rank of jutsu used or or the ignite /3  This explosion cannot be dodged (though the effect which triggered it, if an attack, can still be dodged or otherwise defended against normally).

The gas is also particularly thick, and not particularly breathable. Every 10 IC that someone spends in the cloud adds a Suffocation 1 status to them.

A person is never considered to be affected by more than one Mist Blaze Dance, even if the areas of the techniques overlap. Mist Blaze Dance is removed from the battlefield after a number of IC equal to 30+ your ranks in Chakra Control or if it explodes.

### **Yoen no Jutsu \- Ember-Burning Technique**

One of the few katon jutsu which lacks offensive applications, this technique's rank comes from the precision necessary to perform it without lighting oneself on fire. It literally burns dirt, grime, sweat, and contaminants from the target's clothes and body (without, notably, causing either to go up in flames themselves). It can also be used to sterilize (or, if necessary, cauterize) wounds by tracing them with one's fingertips.

Chakra: 22  
Speed: 5  
Seal Speed: 16

Tags: Utility, Self

Effects:  
Removes all foreign particles and bodies (bugs, chemicals) from the user's clothes and body, stops any ongoing bleeding, and evaporates any liquids covering them (exception: this will ignite the D-rank Sticky Fire Technique). It can even remove recently spilled, not-yet-dried liquids (including blood\!) from clothing. It will not, however, cure poison.  

This provides a \-10 penalty on any attempts to track the user by scent (i.e. Survival rolls), but only a \-5 penalty to find them (i.e. Awareness vs. Stealth) via scent because while their own odor is eliminated, this jutsu leaves a faint scent of smoke. In fact, a difficulty 30 Research roll can identify the use of this technique at, say, a crime scene.  
If used to treat an injury (external injuries which have left open wounds only), this accelerates the recipient's healing time by 25%, but does not stack with the reduction from medical treatment (doctors can do much better than this improvised first aid).

### **Ikari o Moe no Jutsu \- Blazing Fury Technique**

A very, very popular technique among hand-to-hand combatants, whose opinions of it range from "pretty cool" to "totally awesome", this wreathes their hands, and sometimes feet, elbow, and knees, in a faint reddish glow of chakra. When they strike, that chakra ignites on impact, resulting in a burst of flame being delivered to their unfortunate foe. It's quite flashy.

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 14

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
The damage dice of all Unarmed and combo jutsu become !o>3 for d4s, !o>5 for d6s, !o>6 for d8s, !o>7 for d10s, !o>9 for d12s, and !o>15 for d20s (8d12 -> 8d12!o>9).

Additionally, if an attack augmented by Blazing Fury inflicts wounds of any sort, it also causes an Energy wound of one category lower, to a minimum of minor (a punch that inflicted a Minor Blunt wound would also inflict a Minor Energy wound).

### **Katon: Joushou Ootori \- Fire Release: Rising Phoenix Blast**

The user gathers chakra around them--the 'rising phoenix' actually refers to the visible heat ripples and wisps of flame rising around the ninja performing it-- and unleashes a stream of dark, searingly hot fire at their opponents. The flames of this technique are hot enough to disintegrate most incoming attacks.

Chakra: 24  
Damage: 10d20!>16  
Range: CHA  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 12  

Tags: Attack, Interrupt, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
When used as an Interrupt, Rising Phoenix Blast's damage becomes 10d20!>11. It functions differently when used against a melee attack, or projectile ninjutsu attack, that deals damage:

Against a melee attack: The user may choose to call off their attack, or press on regardless of the danger. If they do not cancel their attack each of you are automatically hit by each others attacks without a defense. If they choose to defend themselves, their attack is cancelled. They do not pay any Fatigue costs, their IC is advanced only half as much, any other spent resources are lost. Then they defend against Rising Phoenix Blast as a surprise attack, but have a \+3 bonus to any d20 rolls made as part of their defense.

Against a ranged ninjutsu attack: Compare the damage of the two techniques; if the damage of theirs is higher, subtract Rising Phoenix Blast's damage from that technique's damage; that is how much you take. If your technique's damage is higher, it destroys the opponent's technique, and your enemy must defend against your Rising Phoenix Blast and its remaining damage.

Against Fuuton jutsu you may interrupt AOE jutsu. Rising Phoenix Blast's damage is increased by 25\% for elements weak to it and reduced by 25\% against elements strong against it.

## **Katon B-rank**

### **Katon: Karyuu Endan \- Fire Release: Serpent Flame Bullet**

The shinobi gathers chakra in their mouth, before converting it to fire and shooting it out. The flame shoots out in three sections, each one taking on the appearance of a serpent which explodes on impact with its own target.

Chakra: 36  
Damage: 20d20!o>16
Range: 40  
Speed: 22  
Seal Speed: 22
Special: Ignite 7, Burns 5  

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
This technique may target up to three separate people. You may not direct these 'extra' attacks at the same person for added damage.

### **Gouryuuka no Jutsu \- Great Dragon Fire Technique**

The user of this technique compresses a large amount of chakra in their body, and exhales it as a single, massive burst of fire in the shape of a dragon's head. Due to this technique's nature, enough of the chakra used in it is retained briefly in the user's body to swiftly prepare a second blast.

Chakra: 40
Damage: 42d6!o>6
Range: 35
Area: 20
Speed: 22
Seal Speed: 20

Tags: Attack, AoE, Energy

Effects:  
If this was the last jutsu you performed, its Chakra cost is reduced by 2 and its Seal Speed by 2, and it gains \+1 Accuracy. These bonuses stack, bringing it as low as Chakra 30 and Seal Speed 10, and giving up to \+5 Accuracy.

### **Akuchori Nabe \- Devil's Cooking Pot**

This technique is known for two things. The first is the distinctive, raspy sound made when the user exhales the dark gray cloud of smoke produced by this technique, rather like a death rattle. The second is being wantonly destructive. Due to the composition of the cloud's chakra, it ignites at the outside first, and implodes upon itself, creating a pyroclastic pressure-cooker effect.

Chakra: 30  
Area: 30  
Range: 20  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 28

Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental

Effects:  
Any Katon jutsu of C-rank or higher will be sufficient to ignite the cloud. This increases that technique's Final Damage by 25% and changes its dice from !o> to !>, and everyone within the cloud's area must defend against it. If the Technique already had !> then lower the threshold for exploding dice by 2.

If the technique also has an area of effect, add half of the lower AoE (Akuchori Nabe's or that of the technique which detonated it) to the full higher one; this is the area for the new, combined technique.

### **Jikoku Kasou no Jutsu \- Instant Cremation Technique**

Arguably the most stylish jutsu in existence, after performing the requisite handseals the user keeps their hands charged with chakra (though they do not glow, or burn). From that point on, all they have to do is point at a target and focus for a few seconds, and a location will erupt in flames.  
While this does make it somewhat difficult to evade, there are several telltale signs (aside from the, you know, pointing).  
The area heats up rapidly, and there's a low, rising hum near the point where the flash of fire is imminent, as the chakra being directed there builds and prepares to ignite.

Chakra: 20  
Damage: Xd20!>(20 \- X) 
Accuracy: \+4  
Range: 25 
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 16
Special: Ignite X/2 

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
X is your Cremation upkeep which has a max of 16. As X is 2 or greater, Instant Cremation does not require handseals. After using Instant Cremation, you gain or increase your Cremation Upkeep by 2 which you may end as a Speed 0 action, or immediately after using Instant Cremation. This Cremation Upkeep does not interact with Uniques or Wounds which affect normal Upkeeps. 

For example, if you had used Instant Cremation three times, you would have an Upkeep 6, and your next use of it would deal 6d20\!\>14 damage.


## **Katon A-rank**

### **Katon: Karyuudan \- Fire Release: Fire Dragon Bullet**

Generally considered to be the pinnacle of how destructive a technique can be without rendering it useless in a majority of situations, the user forms a mass of fire in the vague shape of a dragon's head in front of them, and then fires a volley of blazing projectiles at their unfortunate target of choice.

Chakra: 50
Damage: 80d10!o>8
Accuracy: \+2
Range: 60
Speed: 30
Seal Speed: 27

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
This technique inflicts Burns of (damage dealt)/50. You may target up to three people with this technique, using the same Accuracy for each. You can not target the same person repeatedly to enhance the technique's effect.

### **Katon: Ryuujin Bakuha \- Fire Release: Dragon King Blast**

The pinnacle of wide-area indiscriminate destruction. The user exhales a cloud of not-quite-invisible vapor with a metallic taste, which rapidly expands. Once they've finished, they channel just a small bit of chakra into it, turning the gas from inert to violently reactive and engulfing the area in a fireball which has no peer. The user is protected from this explosion; their friends, however, are not.

Chakra: 45
Damage: 40d20!>11
Range: 20
Area: (Damage Bonus)*10
Speed: 30, Delay 20
Seal Speed: 30
Special: Burns 15, Ignite 20, Stun 10

Tags: Attack, AoE, Energy

Effects:  
Every initiative counts in the delay, this technique gains 5% of its damage, radius, and effects. The use of any Katon jutsu of C-rank or above (or the presence of any person suffering from an Ignite status of 10 or greater) in this area will detonate it prematurely.

If an effect is used which would disperse the gas cloud (such as the A-rank Fuuton: Kitakaze) during the Delay period, its damage, range, and effects all reset to 0%; and can be built back up by continuing it.

You may choose to detonate this when you finish it (in which case you will probably be in the area of effect; however, you take only half damage from your own Ryuujin Bakuha), or not. If not, it'll remain for 100 IC or until detonated by the presence of someone with an Ignite 10, or a Katon jutsu of C-rank or above.

Ryuujin Bakuha inflicts an Energy wound, and two Blunt wounds of the same severity. If it's used in a confined space (such as indoors, or in a cave) it does an additional 10d20.open(16) damage, and its effects are raised to Burns 25, Ignite 25, and Stun 20.

### **Sunde Bakudan \- Living Bomb**

A technique invented in the middle of the Third Shinobi World War--and, as the horrors from that era go, it's only slightly atrocious.  
The user molds a mass of volatile fire-elemental chakra and, rather than forming it into a jutsu, injects it directly into a foe. The chakra will last a few minutes at most, before surging through their chakra coils violently and turning them into the catalyst for a powerful explosion.  
It saw extensive use for taking out medics who'd rush to the battlefield to retrieve injured comrades, only to be killed or wounded in the ensuing explosion.

Chakra: 35, raised to 50 if it hits  
Damage: 25d20!>11  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 25  
Seal Speed: 25

Tags: Attack, Melee, Energy

Effects:  
Whoever you hit with this technique becomes a living bomb! When you place this technique, you also set a timer, between 1 and (your Chakra Control skill ranks)*5 IC.At that point, they will detonate. The initial attack itself does not deal damage.

You may also perform a Speed 5, Seal Speed 20 action to detonate someone immediately. When a person is detonated, they make a Chakra 30 roll; whether they pass or fail has no effect on the technique, though as normal they might advance in Fatigue.

The explosion itself is Area 25. The bomb themselves may not defend against it, though anyone else can. The technique's damage is considered 25% higher for the purposes of wounding the bomb.

### **Maru o Moyashi no Jutsu \- Burning Circle Technique**

Popular among bounty-hunting ninja, this technique creates a circular wall of flame surrounding an area. While it's by no means impregnable, attempting to charge through a virtually solid sheet of chakra-fueled fire tends to have the expected result. It's useful both for ensuring an opponent won't run away (or making them pay for trying to do so), and for keeping an adversary isolated from the battle.

Chakra: 45  
Upkeep: 8  
Damage: 40d20!o>6  
Range: 40  
Radius: Up to (ninjutsu damage bonus) \* 5  
Speed: 30  
Seal Speed: 26

Tags: Energy, Environmental

Effects:  
This creates a circular wall of flame centered on a location within range, with the listed radius. The wall itself is 1 yard thick, and (ninjutsu damage bonus) \* 3 yards tall. Anyone who crosses the wall takes the listed damage, as well as an Ignite equal to the user's ninjutsu damage bonus, and a Burn equal to twice the user's ninjutsu damage bonus.

It uses the Speed it was performed at to determine the damage from its user's ninjutsu damage bonus. As it does not constitute an attack at that point, defensive Interrupts can't be used to mitigate it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Raiton**

## Lightning (Raiton)

Nothing out of the ordinary here! This is chakra-based electricity, not real electricity, so it has no special ability to, say, electrocute everyone in contact with water, or anything like that (Though some specific Raiton jutsus DO have similar effects to actual electricity, that is inherent to those jutsus and not the element as a whole).

[|E-Ranks|](#raiton-e-rank)
[|D-Ranks|](#raiton-d-rank)
[|C-Ranks|](#raiton-c-rank)
[|B-Ranks|](#raiton-b-rank)
[|A-Ranks|](#raiton-a-rank)

## **Raiton E-rank**

### **Rashinban no Jutsu \- Compass Technique**

It's about what it sounds like. The user channels lightning elemental chakra into a needle, or kunai, or similar-sized and \-shaped object, which will then, when laid flat (sometimes requiring a few taps to help it along) point towards magnetic north.

Chakra: 5  
Speed: 4  
Seal Speed: 12

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
Allows a single kunai or senbon to be used as a compass for 6 hours or until used in an attack. It's not quite perfect, but it's good enough for most uses. In combat, this jutsu allows the user to perform a Search action (that stacks and does not interrupt previous Searches) with a \+2 bonus per 1 level of Raiton-induced Paralysis on any targets within CHA yards.

### **Shougeki Heki \- Shocking Burst**

Holding a hand out there is a pulse of electricity. This isn't nearly enough to kill anyone, but it definitely hurts.

Chakra: 10  
Damage: 1d12\*1d4  
Range: 10  
Speed: 4  
Seal Speed: 6
Special: Paralysis 1 for 20 IC

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
Shocking Burst's Speed may not be reduced below 4 and can target up to three targets in range.

### **Seiden \- Static Electricity**

A simple application of one of Raiton's basic properties. In which the user makes a single hand sign before extending their hand out to a target. There are two primary ways to use this jutsu. The first is to stop just inches short of touching the target, at which point a small jolt of lightning will arc from the user's fingertips towards the target. This is effective at igniting flammables or providing painful but ultimately harmless shocks on others, a favorite prank amongst Academy Students. The second method, one that tends to be used a slight bit more by the slightly more mature shinobi, is to concentrate the electricity into your palm and wave it at a nearby object. The user then transfers the stored electric shock into the object, this actually multiplies the static charge, giving a much more painful jolt to the next person to touch it. Shocking them. This method is arguably even better for setting up pranks and even the more serious shinobi have used it at least once on somebody they didn't like.

Chakra: 7  
Damage: 1d6\*1d6  
Range: 5  
Speed: 3
Seal Speed: 1  
Tags: Energy
Special: Stun 1, Paralysis 1 for 1 IC

Effects:

If done at touch, make a Taijutsu ACC attack, should the hit land, apply Para 1 and Stun 1 for 1 IC. This can also be used on flammable objects to to ignite them.

If done at range, choose an unoccupied object within range, the next person to try and pick it up will get para 1 for 10 ICs and Stun 5\. And will drop the object.

## **Raiton D-rank**

### **Mahi Kyukei \- Paralysis Break**

You gather a tiny, but wild and fluctuating marble of Raiton energy between your finger and thumb and fling it at your opponent. It's too small to do any actual damage, but the energy is so unstable that if any Raiton energy is still lingering in someone's system when they're hit by it it causes the energy to rapidly rush out of their body. Whilst on one hand this is good because the energy leaves your system faster, it also causes your muscles to freeze up whilst it does.

Chakra: 12
Accuracy: \+2
Range: 20
Speed: 10
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Utility, Projectile

Effects:  
The highest Raiton induced paralysis effect with an IC timer on it has the IC timer halved, but the severity of the paralysis doubled." For example: If they had Para 1 for 20 IC it would turn into Para 2 for 10 IC

### **Shuurai \- Lightning Strike**

You focus energy to the tips of your fingers on either hand, then point at an opponent, releasing a reasonably sized bolt of electricity. This is nothing like real lightning, but it looks similar and is just as fast\! Well… Not really, but it is really fast… Really… You have to believe me.

Chakra: 16
Damage: 2d6\*2d6
Accuracy: \+2
Range: 20
Speed: 10
Seal Speed: 7
Special: Paralysis 1 for 15 IC

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:
This ignores DR by 50% when dealing damage.

### **Nage no Ushinawa Jutsu \- Subjugating Cattle Lasso Technique**

Shinobi as a rule, must become very adaptable, learning how to use whatever they have on hand to create the most lethal traps or tools to escape with their lives. This technique represents such ingenuity. With just a couple of Shuriken or Kunai and some spools of metal wire, a ninja adept with Lightning Release can develop a deadly weapon. You begin by linking together the two Kunai or Shuriken through a wire so thin it is impossible to see and in that same instant, infusing them with a charge of electricity. And just as quickly, the two weapons are thrown at your enemy at such an angle that they will miss them with one going off on either side of them. Your enemy will likely laugh at you now for having the aim of a certain visored trooper. But that's just where you want them to be\! For at that moment, the wire will collide with their body, causing the Kunai to turn around and wrap around their body with electrically charged wire.

Chakra: 18  
Range: Same as thrown weapon  
Speed: 9  
Seal Speed: 10  
Special: Paralysis 2, Immobilization 2  
Requires: 2 Kunai or Shuriken and 5 yards of Ninja Wire  

Tags: Attack, Projectile

Effects: 
If this hits, the target becomes Grappled and is treated as if they are in a Clinch, except it is with the wire instead of you. Typically, the wire is easy to break out of for Chakra enhanced ninja. However, the addition of Raiton increases the wire's durability and disorganizes the target's musculature enough that they can't as easily summon their strength to escape. The Wire is treated as having 1d20+10+CHA/8 for Grapple Rolls to any relevant Break Clinch or Escape Grapple attempts. Anybody attempting to escape gains a cumulative +5 to any Escape Grapple or Break Clinch actions after the first one. The Wire does not get any bonuses from a target's failed Break Clinch actions. 

The Target has Paralysis 2 and Immob 2 so long as they are clinched by the wire.

### **Juude \- Electric Charge**

Rubbing your hands together you create a large electrical charge, which only needs the slightest touch to be delivered, and will temporarily energize the opponent with an amount of lightning-elemental chakra.  

Chakra: 10
Accuracy: \+2
Range: Melee
Speed: 6
Seal Speed: 6

Tags: Attack, Utility, Melee

Effects:  
This 'charges' an opponent, and gives the next ranged Raiton technique used against them an Accuracy bonus of \+1, plus the severity of any Paralysis they have. Thus, when using Raiton against someone with Juude and Paralysis 3 you'd have a \+4 Accuracy bonus.

### **Jinrai no Jutsu \- Thunderclap Technique**

The user puts both hands together, forming a miniature thunder bolt between his hands, splitting the air and forming an extremely loud BANG, which is rather startling when you're a few feet from it, and not expecting it. It has the added benefits of temporarily deafening the opponent.

Chakra: 16  
Area: 10 
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 9
Special: Stun 8

Tags: Utility, AoE

Effects:
Anybody that gains stun, for the next 30 ICs, receives a -5 to all Awareness checks alongside losing all their ranks in Enhanced Hearing and any other Ability that requires it. This jutsu cannot be used again for 100 IC.

### **Shinkei Attou no Jutsu \- Nerve Overloading Technique**

You send a 'spark' of chakra into an enemy, stimulating any electrical chakra already in their system and sending them into several seconds of agonizing convulsions.

Chakra: 16
Accuracy: \+X
Range: 15
Speed: 8
Seal Speed: 8
Special: Stun 5 \* X

Tags: Attack, Projectile

Effects:  
X is the level of Paralysis on the target. Thus, someone suffering from Paralysis 4 would be Stunned for 20 IC and you’d have a +4 Accuracy.

### **Kyousou Ikazuchi no Jutsu \- Racing Thunder Technique**

By pumping your legs full of lightning chakra, you raise your muscle's response time, and their power as well. Unfortunately, this is all focused on just your legs.

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 4  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 8

Tags: Utility

Effects:  
Your AGI is treated as 25% higher for the purposes of movement. Additionally, so long as you maintain this Technique’s Upkeep, you gain a special Movement Action called Blink.

Blink: You may choose to declare a Speed X Move Action, where X has a max of AGI/5. Unlike normal movement (which is handled on an IC-by-IC basis), the movement for this action is resolved immediately. However, moving this way has a Stamina cost equal to X. You may not reduce this Action's Speed by spending AP.

### **Kaminari no Yaiba \- Lightning Blade**

You mold your chakra into a cackling weapon made entirely of lightning energy that extends from your hand. This weapon’s cutting power can bypass almost any defense, though it’s harder to control than a solid weapon would be.

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 2  
Speed: 5  
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Energy, Weapon, Utility

Effects:  
You acquire a Chain from the standard Chain options in the Equipment section. You may then upgrade it using Artisan points equal to your Chakra Control \- 5. You may choose to double the Base Speed and Upkeep of this Technique to create a second Chain in your other hand during the activation of this Technique. Both weapons gain the dual property (for free) but the artisan points must be split between the 2 weapons.

When using it, you reduce any DR by 50% when dealing damage (or 100% against DR sources that are weak to Raiton). This Club lasts until you let go of it or end this Technique’s Upkeep. You may perform Handseals while holding Lightning Whips, but doing so increases the Seal Speed by 4 for one Whip, and 6 for two Whips.

### **Taiyouken \- Solar Flare**

You gather Chakra within your body and release it in a blinding flash of light that blinds opponents who are not fast enough to close their eyes. Whether you blind them or they close their eyes in time, this gives you a window to hide from them.

Chakra: 10  
Area: 10  
Speed: 9  
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Utility, AoE

Effects:  
When you use this technique, you and anyone in the Area make an opposed Initiative roll, with the victim(s) getting a \+2 bonus for each previous time this technique has been used in that combat. Whoever you beat with this roll suffers a \-4 Visibility Penalty that fades at the rate of 1 per 5 IC, anyone you don’t beat closes their eyes in time. Regardless of who you beat with the roll (even if you don't beat anyone at all), you can immediately Hide as per the Hide action using all normal rules for it.

## **Raiton C-rank**

### **Shougeki Ken \- Shocking Fist**

You focus your chakra around your extremities and transform it into an electric current that numbs whoever you pummel with your Taijutsu attacks. And bypasses any protection they may have had to directly shock their internal organs.

Chakra: 15  
Upkeep: 5 
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 14  

Tags: Utility

As long as this technique is maintained, your Unarmed and Combo Taijutsu attacks that deal any damage inflict a Paralysis status of 1, plus 1 per severity of any wound they inflict (\+1 for Minor, \+2 for Major, etc). This Paralysis fades by 1 every 10 ICs.

Your Taijutsu Attacks ignore armor and treat DR as if it is 33% lower.

### **Shimeshi Ryouiki \- Dampening Field**

Concentrating your chakra, you project an invisible, wide area dome of chakra. Maintaining its stability requires you to stay practically immobile at its center, but the effects are virtually impossible to circumvent without finding the originator.

Anyone who enters the field will instantly notice its presence--their hair will start to stand on end, and most objects will begin building a static charge.

Chakra: 24
Upkeep: 6
Area: CHA
Speed: 13
Seal Speed: 22

Tags: Utility, AoE, Self, Environmental

Effects:  
So long as you maintain this Jutsu's upkeep, you are afflicted by Immobility 10, which can not be reduced or removed by any means. You can not end this Jutsu like normal; you must take a Speed 10, Delay 5 action to end this Jutsu's Upkeep. No actions can be performed so long as the Upkeep is maintained. Moving somehow or Being forcibly moved causes this Jutsu to end. 
Within the field, all chakra-based sensing (such as Byakugan's vision, chakra-sensory ninja, and the Yurokensei technique) receive \-10 to Awareness and Chakra Control checks for the purposes of sensing. Electronic and electrical devices in this area are also useless (Including a magnetized compass made using Raiton).

The damping also interferes with other lightning-based chakra, reducing the damage of all Raiton in its range to 50%. Finally, the large amounts of ambient lightning chakra interferes with earth-based chakra. Doton techniques in this area have their damage reduced by 40%, and their Chakra costs and Upkeeps (if relevant) increased by 6.

### **Raiton: Amigumo \- Lightning Release: Spider Web**

Chakra: 16  
Damage: 2d20d1*2d6  
Area: 10
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 15  
Special: Paralysis 2 for 20 ICs  

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:
If this Technique is the last attack you used, and you haven't performed any hand seals since the last time you used it, it does not require handseals. Additionally, every consecutive time this Technique is performed it gains \+1 Accuracy Bonus, \+4 chakra cost, and the Severity of the Paralysis increases by 1, and its Duration increases by 10. These effects stack twice. So the second time this is used in a row, it becomes \+1 ACC, Chakra 20, Paralysis 3, Duration 30. Then \+2 ACC, Chakra 24, Para 4, Duration 40.

When used consecutively, add half the damage of the highest of all previous consecutive uses for the purpose of determining wounds. For example, say you dealt 60, then 40, then 50 damage with it. For determining if you wounded your opponent, the first technique would be treated as 60 damage, the second as (40 \+ 60/2) = 70, and the third as (50 \+ 60/2) = 80.

### **Kangekiha \- Wave of Inspiration**

Focusing a great amount of lightning chakra into their hands the user then places them on or near something that will conduct the attack into their opponent. Be it something metal or something wet, or whatever, as long as there is a conductive material, there will be a target who is hit\!

Chakra: 20  
Damage: 2d8\*5d4  
Accuracy: \-8  
Range: 40  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 16

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
If this is used on a conductive surface (such as a metal pipe, or the surface of a lake) that your opponent is in contact with, its Accuracy penalty is removed and your damage bonus is doubled.  

If someone was hit by a Suiton ninjutsu in the past 15 IC, this technique's Accuracy penalty is reduced to \-2, but your damage bonus is not increased.  
For every point of Raiton Induced Paralysis a target is suffering from, this gains a \+2 Accuracy Bonus; however, if this hits their Paralysis status is ended.

### **Tesura Karui \- Tesla Minor**

This generates a semi-stable mass of lightning chakra which will be released right in front of you. The mass is a bright and crackling sphere of chakra that will fly at a leisurely pace towards the closest person charged with Raiton chakra. Anyone unfortunate enough to come into contact with it will receive a dangerous shock through their system as the sphere of Lightning bursts, causing a surprising amount of destruction.

Chakra: 18
Damage: 25*1d8
Speed: 10
Seal Speed: 21
Special: Paralysis 2, for 30 IC, Stun 5

Tags: Utility, Creation

Effects:

This creates a sphere of Lightning energy 1 yard in front of you. When it's created, the sphere will initially remain inert, gathering charge from the atmosphere. During this duration, contact with it is harmless and causes nothing except for making hair stand up straight. Once 15 ICs have passed, the sphere will activate and begin moving, flying towards the nearest person with Raiton-Induced Paralysis on them. If it reaches somebody, then they will take the designated damage alongside your NDB multiplied by the speed that was used to initially create the Sphere. This cannot be defended against. DR values are halved. And Blocking (Which, given the fact you can’t defend against this attack, requires you to have been blocking beforehand) reduces the damage by 25% only.

The sphere moves at a speed of 0.5 yards per 1 IC for every 1 Paralysis the current target has. If the nearest viable target is somebody in stealth, it will still target them and will automatically reveal them should it hit them. A giant flash of lightning is hard not to notice. If there are no viable targets with Raiton-Induced Paralysis in the battlefield then the sphere will go still in its current position. It only lasts for 50 ICs from the moment it was created (meaning it only has 35 ICs to chase somebody), after 50 ICs have passed the sphere loses its form and the chakra dissipates, ending the technique prematurely.

### **Chuubu Gaki no Jutsu \- Ghoul Paralysis Technique**

After making contact with an enemy, you send a powerful pulse of electricity through their body, momentarily overstimulating their nervous system. For several seconds afterwards, the recipient of the shock will find their body sluggish and poorly responsive. While not actual harmful, this is exceptionally painful.

Chakra: 16
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 10
Special: Paralysis 4 for 40 IC

Tags: Attack, Melee

Effects:  
Even if the target succeeds on their Status Check they gain Paralysis 2 for 20 ICs.

### **Raiton: Fukushuu Kaminarikami \- Lightning Release: Avenging Lightning God**

You divert your chakra to surge across your skin, building up something akin to a strong static charge. Unlike actual static electricity, this is incredibly dangerous.

Chakra: 18  
Upkeep: 4  
Damage: 4d6*4d4  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 12  
Special: Paralysis X for 15 IC, This technique receives only half your damage bonus

Tags: Interrupt, Energy

Effects:
You can use this technique as an Interrupt against any attacks made at NDB range increasings its chakra cost by 6. If you do, your opponent can immediately abort their attack, in which they still pay its cost and it's considered half its actual speed for determining when their next action comes. If they do not abort the attack, then you are hit automatically by their attack (taking its normal damage) and your attacker is also automatically hit by this technique (taking its normal damage). 

While maintaining this upkeep you may reactivate the above effect as a Speed 0 Chakra 18 interrupt in response to any attack or damaging jutsu.

X in this technique is the severity of wounds inflicted from both sides of this technique (if they dealt a major and you dealt a minor X would be 3).

## **Raiton B-rank**

### **Raijuu Hashiri no Jutsu \- Lightning Beast Running Technique**

Charging both your hands with a powerful electric current, you slam them together and expel a creature made of pure lightning, in whatever form you choose (one of a realistic, quadripedal animal). The beast then runs at your enemy, connected to your hands by a lightning 'leash' that allows you to redirect the attack if an enemy defends against it.

Chakra: 40  
Damage: 5d10\*3d4  
Range: 40  
Speed: 14
Seal Speed: 20
Special: Paralysis 2 for 30 IC

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
After seeing the result of your opponent's defense, you may choose to make them reroll it. If you do this, they keep the second result (even if it's better). If you use this option, Raijuu Hashiri's damage is halved for the purpose of determining wounds, and its Paralysis status is removed.  
You may also use the redirect to send the beast after a different target; it still suffers the usual reductions this way.

### **Raiton Bunshin no Jutsu \- Lightning Release Clone Technique**

This technique creates a potent, not-quite-fully independent copy of yourself. They're capable of bringing substantial force to bear in combat, but lack enough physical cohesion to survive being hit in combat. Of course, striking a ball of animated lightning tends to be bad for one's health.

Chakra: 15 \+5 * X  
Damage: 100 \* 1d4
Speed: 8, \+4 per clone  
Seal Speed: 12, \+4 \* X
Special: Paralysis 4 for 30 IC  
Requires: Bunshin no Jutsu

Tags: Utility, Energy, Clone

Effects:  
You can create up to two clones. These function like regular bunshin, but You create X clones up to a max of 2. These function like regular bunshin, but may take the actions listed below:

\[X AP\] Move: Your clones can move, where X is the Speed of the Move action.  
\[4 AP\] Basic Unarmed: A basic unarmed attack, using your attributes.  
\[X AP\] Basic Weapon: You may transfer any number of weapons to your Raiton Bunshin when you create them. They may attack with those weapons, using your abilities. X is half the Speed of the attack.  
\[X AP\] Multi-Throw: Should be self-explanatory. X is half the Speed of the multi-throw.  
\[X AP\] Raiton Ninjutsu: The clone must first perform the handseals, at the regular speed, costing AP equal to half the technique's modified Seal Speed. It then costs X AP, where X is half the technique's Speed. They cannot, however, use Raiton Bunshin.

Anyone who destroys a Lightning Clone within a 1 yard range takes this technique's damage automatically. 

Lightning Clones are all at Fatigue 0; if they ever reach Fatigue 1, they are destroyed. When Lightning Clones attack they use only half your damage bonus for dealing damage, and the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category.

Lightning Clones use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses, as if they were a Fatigue 0 version of you without any temporary benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If a clone fails a Fatigue roll, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.

### **Gian \- False Darkness**

A fearsome technique made in the village of clouds during a time of international strife. It was meant not for individual duels, but for warfare, proving devastatingly effective for its intended purpose. In the last Shinobi War, few things were feared more than Kumogakure's Raiton Shinobi battalions who would all stand in a line far from any possible retaliatory strike and rain down thunder on a faraway battlefield. While the original technique's true deadliness can only be displayed with dozens of skilled Shinobi working in tandem. A modified version has been made for personal use by one of the other villages and eventually spread to the rest of the Ninja World. Holding their hands up towards the sky after completing the handseals the user can send out a burst of Lightning Chakra into the atmosphere which will multiply the energy before it fell back down into the Shinobi's grasp. The ninja then, depending on how much energy he sent into the atmosphere, forms that mass of energy into up to half a dozen large, spear shaped bolts of lightning which can then be chucked extremely long distances like a javelin. As the javelin's descend, their speed will suddenly increase tenfold, causing them to slam into the ground with the same force and ferocity of a true thunderbolt. This technique's  biggest advantage is its ability to be used in rapid succession, allowing for rapid long-range bombardment.

Chakra: 32 \+ (X \* 3\)  
Damage: 4d20 \* 1d(12 \- X \* 2\)  
Range: 100  
Area: 20  
Speed: 12, Delay: X \* 3  
Seal Speed: 26

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
X can’t be higher than 5. Each X represents an attack, performing a different ACC attack and damage for each. The target only needs to declare one interrupt, moving their IC and paying any appropriate  costs only once, but they still roll to defend against each attack. Whatever interrupt the target has chosen is the one they must use to defend against all attacks. Every thunderbolt from Gian that hits applies a stacking Paralysis 1 Duration 20 that stacks only from the same instance of Gian. Speed can never be lowered below 12.

### **Raiton: Shichuu Shibari \- Lightning Release: Four Pillar Bind**

Four pillars of rock, each about twenty feet tall, are summoned around an enemy (don't ask how that works for a lightning jutsu). Lightning arcs between the pillars, flooding the area with electricity. While the damage done by this technique is fairly mild, it can easily immobilize someone within the area.

Chakra: 36  
Upkeep: 5  
Range: CHA/2  
Line: 25, 25
Speed: 19  
Seal Speed: 20
Special: Paraylsis 2, Immob 4

Tags: Energy, AoE, Creation, Environmental

Effects:
Each of the Pillars has 250 HP and is situated on the four corners of the Square area. They have a DR of 10+CHA/5. Anybody inside of the area gains Immobilization 4, and Paralysis 2 until they leave the Area of the Jutsu. In addition, they take 5 damage that cannot be mitigated every IC that passes. The Pillars can be attacked, and if one is destroyed, the Jutsu forcibly ends alongside its effects.

### **Nage no Ushisekuta Jutsu \- Subjugating Cattle Field Technique**

Taking the Subjugating Cattle Lasson Technique to the very extreme, this has stopped being a mere trap or trick utilized when one is desperate and has no other options. A proof that the Shinobi are masters at transforming tools used out of necessity and refining them into lethal weapons. An Experienced Ninja that has mastered Ushisekuta can become a deadly threat on a battlefield. By attaching two sets of 4 Kunai or Shuriken using Ninja Wire, the Shinobi is able to throw them with a highly concentrated current of Lightning passing through them. With 1 set sticking into the ground and the other freezing in the air dozens of meters above it, the Lightning Chakra begins to jump between the two closed circuits, creating veritable walls of electricity. And effectively closing off that entire zone from the rest of the battlefield.

Chakra: 40
Upkeep: 3
Cube: 20
Damage: 8d8\*2d4
Speed: 14
Seal Speed: 18
Requires: 8 Kunai or Shuriken, 80 yards of Ninja Wire

Tags: Energy, AoE, Environmental

Effects:
This fences off a zone in the battlefield. Making a cube of Raiton walls and ceiling. Anyone attempting to enter or exit the zone will impact the barrier and take the mentioned Dice Damage without adding NDB or speed. and must roll a status check with a \+2 bonus for every time they attempt to pass the barriers after the first attempt. Anyone who fails the roll gains Stun 10 and Paralysis 3 until the end of the Stun and is pushed back 5 yards into the direction they originally came from. For example, somebody inside the zone attempting to cross out will be knocked back 5 yards into the zone. As it does not constitute an attack at that point, defensive Interrupts can't be used to mitigate it. However, If the last action you declared was Blocking, you may use Block to defend against this jutsu when passing through it. You may block as part of moving through the barrier so long as you are using normal Movement.

Attacks pass normally into and out of the Cattle Field Technique’s zone.

If Chakra based movement such as Shunshin, Racing Thunder, Vaulting Leap, or Water Shark Blast are used to pass the barrier, you may use Chakra Control instead of Resistance to resist the Knockback, Stun, and Paralysis. Blocked cannot be used as part of these movements to reduce Cattle Field’s damage.

Cattle Field technique does not extend into the ground, if you manage to dig 1 yard into the earth, such as through “Hiding Like a Mole Technique” then you may pass beneath the barrier without triggering it.

The Cube of this Jutsu cannot be increased any further even through the Enhanced Area Ability.

### **Hiyaku Raikoui \- Chain Lightning**

You hold out your fingers and fire a focused bolt of lightning which then, after striking the target, goes to find a new target, then another, amplifying itself each time it passes through someone's chakra circulatory system.

Chakra: 38
Damage: 6d8\*1d10
Range: 50
Speed: 12
Seal Speed: 18

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy

Effects:  
This has an Accuracy bonus equal to the severity of Paralysis its target is suffering from, \+1 for every previous target it hits. After hitting one person it can then 'jump' to any other target within half the original range from its most recent victim, doing 10% more damage for each target previously hit.

Anyone struck by this technique has their Paralysis status raised by 1, and its duration increased by 5 iC. A person can only be hit by a single use of this technique once.  
The maximum number of targets a single activation of Chain Lightnin can hit is equal to your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus.

## **Raiton A-rank**

### **Kouken Rairyuu \- Guardian Lightning Dragon**

Harnessing a great amount of chakra, you create a field of lightning that swirls around you and coalesces into the crackling outline of an electric dragon. From there you can keep it at the ready, or attack an unfortunate foe immediately.

Chakra: 45
Damage: 5d8\*6d6
Range: 80
Speed: 26
Seal Speed: 30
Special: Paralysis 4 for 60 IC

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Energy, Creation

Effects:  
When you use this technique, you may choose to lower its Chakra cost by 10. If you do so, rather than launching at your opponents the lightning dragon takes shape coiling around you.

It will automatically attack the first person to move within 10 yards of you (it will not, however, trigger this effect if you move closer to them), with +4 Accuracy. You may also launch the dragon at any time while it's still around, as a Chakra 35, Speed 14 action, using 14 rather than 26 as its base speed.

### **Tenchu \- Wrath of Heaven**

This technique truly earns its name. As the handseals are completed electricity will begin to arc along the user's body and wisps of dark smoke will rise from them, a result of the overwhelming, uncontainable amounts of chakra this jutsu requires.  
That chakra is converted directly into electricity and released in a blast every bit as devastatingly powerful as a genuine bolt of lightning.

Chakra: 50
Damage: 2d10d1\*2d8d1\*2d6d1\*2d4d1
Line: 30, 100
Speed: 30
Seal Speed: 40
Special: Paralysis 6 for 50 ICs, This technique receives only half your damage bonus.

Tags: Attack, Projectile, AoE, Energy

Effects:  
The effectiveness of partial defense is halved against this technique: for every 1 point it misses by, it deals only 10% less damage.

After rolling damage for Tenchu, you may spend a point of Willpower to reroll it and take the higher of the two results. This may only be done once per attack.

### **Juurokuchuu Shibari \- Sixteen Pillar Bind**

Just as the four pillar bind, this surrounds the area, though this time it's a bit more solid. After creating a large, oven-like structure it then electrocutes the entire area inside, frying the contents and hopefully making it hard for them to escape.

Chakra: 60
Upkeep: 12
Range: 120
Cube: 100
Speed: 30
Seal Speed: 35

Tags: Energy, AoE, Environmental

Effects:  
Each Pillar has 300 HP and a DR of 20+CHA/5.

This is a Cube 25, inside a Cube 50, inside a Cube 75, inside a Cube 100; thus, it's 25 yards from the edge of one layer to the next. For each layer a person is inside they suffer \-2 Immobilize and 1 Paralyze.

Thus, someone at the center would be at \-8 Immobilize and Paralyze 4, until they managed to run 25 yards or destroy a pillar from one set; then they'd be at \-6 Immobilize and Paralyze 3, and so forth.

This lasts so long as you maintain its upkeep. You are immune to its effects.

### **Raitama \- Ball Lightning**

Upon completion of the handseals the user forms a ball of raw, condensed lightning chakra between their palms, then encases it in a more stable 'shell' made from hundreds of interwoven chakra strands, creating a mesh-like barrier that prevents the inner chakra from dissipating.  
After that, they can either leave the resulting ball of chakra hovering where it was made or hide it inside some appropriately sized physical object, typically the ground, where it will lie in wait until someone comes close enough to trigger the mine. When they do, it seeks them out and detonates on contact.

Chakra: 40  
Upkeep: 8  
Damage: 500  
Range: 60  
Speed: 50  
Seal Speed: 25

Tags: Utility, Creation

Effects:  
The mine must be placed within melee range. The technique's actual range can, if you wish, be set lower than 60\. Whenever someone other than you enters this range, they immediately become the target of a Sneak Attack from this jutsu using your ranks in Stalker; the ball of lightning soars towards them without warning.

This can be left sitting in the opponent (as an effective deterrent), or submerged into any available surface (the floor, the walls). If you are within the maximum range (even if you reduced the attack range), you can prevent the ball from activating by concentrating on it (though you'd typically need line of sight to know if this is necessary).  
If this is hidden inside some object, it cannot be detected without the use of a chakra-detecting doujutsu (such as Byakugan).

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Suiton**

## Water (Suiton)
Water is at a disadvantage among elemental jutsu in that it requires raw material to use (earth techniques do as well, but it's rare to find oneself in a situation without ground).Unless the fight is taking place near a river (a small stream won't cut it) or a lake, or, say, on a boat, it's not going to be from the environment.

Accordingly, most water jutsu tend to be very weak or have limited effectiveness unless the shinobi supplies enough “Gallons of Water”, not to mention quite costly. However, using enough gallons of water can turn an ineffectual technique into quite a fearsome force. Even water, in enough quantity, can be turned into a destructive tsunami. 

Using “Gallons of Water” is quite easy, you simply mention how many Gallons you are investing into a Jutsu when you use it, and modify its “G” (Standing for, you guessed it, Water) variable according to how many Gallons you spent. Though it should be kept in mind that most Suiton Jutsus have a minimum and a maximum amount of Water you can invest into it (Typically displayed like this: 4 > 12 Gallons of Water), anything more or less and the technique breaks down. If a Technique has a Gallon requirement of 0, that means you may use it without spending any Water on it, though that also means it’ll be quite weak.

There are two primary ways to bring water into a battle where there otherwise is none: the first is to physically carry it, typically in a large gourd (see the Equipment chapter). The other is the D rank Water Creation Technique, which may add Gallons of Water to the Background, making those Gallons accessible to everybody in the battlefield until the Water is used up.

Used water is typically scattered across the battlefield, or evaporates back into the atmosphere as pure chakra, meaning it cannot be used in a technique again--it is lost. You can't use water someone else is carrying into battle (Like through a Container), but water in the Background or environment is fair game.

## **Suiton E-rank**

### **Mizudama no Jutsu \- Water Sphere Technique**

The user gathers the water used in this technique in front of them as they perform the handseals, and then directs it at an opponent as a high-speed projectile.

Chakra: 5 \+ (G \* 2)
Damage: 2d10\+(G \* 10)
Range: 15
Speed: 7
Seal Speed: 5 \+ G
Gallons Requirements: 0 \> 2

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

### **Mizuhane \- Water Splash**

You strike the ground with your foot, and cause a spray of water to splash up between you and an attacker. It's not terribly practical, but it does provide about a quarter-second of a distraction.

Chakra: G \* 5 
Speed: \+G  
Seal Speed: G \* 2  
Gallon Requirement: 1 \> 5  

Tags: Interrupt, Link, Self

Effects: This is used alongside a Dodge Interrupt, and provides it with a +G bonus. Your dodge's final speed cannot go lower than G.

### **Haneru \- Splash**

You use Splash\!

Chakra: 5  
Speed: 1
Seal Speed: 2

Tags: Joke

Effects:  
Nothing happens\!

## **Suiton D-rank**

### **Suiton: Teppoudama \- Water Release: Liquid Bullet**

The user kneads chakra and converts it into water inside their stomach, then spits it out in the form of a dense, chakra propelled ball. Its greatest boon to suiton users is that it can be used in an area without any preexisting water.

Chakra: 13
Damage: 6d8+30 
Range: 12  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 9

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

Effects:  
This adds 3 gallons of water to the battlefield every time it's used.

### **Suiton: Shigure \- Water Release: Drizzle**

The user condenses the water in the air to fire multiple blasts in unison. This allows for large crowd control or by focusing them into single targets it produces a much stronger attack.

Chakra: 12 \+ G
Damage: (3d8\+20)\*(1\+0.2\*X)
Range: 15
Speed: 7 \+ G
Seal Speed: 5 \+ G
Accuracy:  +X /4
Gallons Requirements: 2 \> 8

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Blunt

Effects:
You fire G number of projectiles and can direct them at a single target or split them evenly between any number of targets. The X for this jutsu is determined by the number of projectiles thrown at each individual target. 

### **Takigakure Ryu, Mizukiri no Yaiba \- Hidden Waterfall Style, Water-Cutting Blade**

Originally developed by the Hidden Waterfall village, this technique has since spread into wider use. The first half of the name is generally dropped, though some choose to keep it out of respect. The jutsu creates a blade out of water, kept as strong as most metals by the chakra infusing it.

Chakra: 6 \+ G  
Upkeep: 1  
Speed: 4  
Seal Speed: 8  
Gallon Requirement: 3 \> 6

Tags: Utility, Self, Creation

Effects: 
You acquire a Sword from the standard Sword options in the Equipment section. You may then upgrade it using Artisan points equal to your Chakra Control \- 5. You may choose to double the Base Speed and Upkeep of this Technique to create a second Sword in your other hand during the activation of this Technique. Both weapons gain the dual property (for free) but the artisan points must be split between the 2 weapons.

Any Swords created gain a static damage value added alongside the dice roll which is equal to (G \* 5). This Sword lasts until you let go of it or end this Technique’s Upkeep. You may perform Handseals while holding water swords, but doing so increases the Seal Speed by 4 for one blade, and 6 for two blades.

### **Kirigakure no Jutsu \- Hidden Mist Technique**

Chakra: G \* 2
Upkeep: 3 \+ (G / 2)
Area: 10 \+ G Yard Radius centered on you
Speed: 6 \+ G
Seal Speed: 11
Gallons Requirement: 4 > 12

Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental

Effects: 
This imposes a \-G Visibility penalty to everyone in the Area as a supernaturally thick mist blankets the field. After you stop paying the upkeep, the mist's penalty fades at a rate of 1 per 5 IC. This mist is always centered on you.

### **Suiton: Namerakana Amamizu \- Water Release: Rainwater Slick**

The user splashes a small area with water, infusing it with their chakra. This layer of chakra causes the water to support a person's weight for just long enough that when it gives out, they'll risk slipping and falling embarrassingly. Anything coated in this is, similarly, hard to hold on to.

Chakra: 12  
Range: 25  
Area: 15  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 9

Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental

Effects:  
Make a Chakra Control roll when you first lay down this technique, with a \+5 bonus.

Anyone who moves through this area by any means must choose to halve their speed or be forced to roll an Athletics check against that number. On a failure they become prone. This extends to determining penalties for AoE attacks. If they choose to move at full speed, they must make an Athletics Check against the same TN or fall Prone (though they still move the full amount). The Prone’s penalties do apply to any Defense against the Attack this was in response to.

Anybody inside the Area of Rainwater Slick suffers from Immobilization \-1, as they have to put a little more thought into all of their actions.


### **Mizu Souzou no Jutsu \- Water Creation Technique**

You convert raw chakra into pure water. This technique is popular among serious users of suiton techniques, as it lets them avoid picking and choosing their battles so carefully, and allows them to eschew the practice of carrying around large gourds of water (which, in addition to giving away their specialty, are unpleasantly heavy).

Chakra: 5 \+ X
Speed: 8
Seal Speed: 5 \+ (X / 2)

Tags: Utility, Link

Effects:  
You create X gallons of water. This may be used alongside a jutsu with a gallon cost, in which case its Speed and Seal Speed are used to pay for that technique. It may also be used alone, in which case the created water is deposited on the battlefield or a container you are wearing that has the space for it.

### **Mekkyaku \- Extinguishment**

It was recently discovered that covering oneself in water is a highly effective countermeasure to being on fire\! Thus, this technique: An alternative to the ever-popular "stop, drop, and roll", the ninja drenches themselves or a nearby object in water.

Chakra: 10
Range: G
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 10
Gallons Requirement: 1 \> X  
Tags: Utility

Effects: This reduces any Ignite penalties you are suffering from by the amount of Gallons spent on this Technique.

## **Suiton C-rank**

### **Suiton: Suikoudan \- Water Release: Water Shark Blast**

After creating the handseals, you launch water in projectile form at an opponent. Some ninja like to etch the outline of a shark's head into the end of this projectile; others, who believe that being a ninja is very serious business, prefer to omit that part of the technique. Experienced users can even use this to allow themselves to fly quickly through the water, while protecting themselves with the might of the tearing shark.

Chakra: 13 \+ G
Damage: 8d12 \+ (G \* 8)
Line: 3, G \* 2
Speed: 13
Seal Speed: 7 \+ (G / 2)
Gallons Requirement: 5 \> 12

Tags: Attack, AoE, Blunt

Effects:
You may move to any location along the area of this technique, unhindered by anything which would normally prevent you from moving. You may ignore other Ground-Based effects during this movement.

### **Mizutamari no Jutsu \- Pool of Water Technique**

A moderately advanced technique is the appropriately named water-walking technique; molding chakra below one's feet to 'stand' on patches of water without any actual expenditure of energy, and, once it's perfected, only minimal concentration. This technique builds upon that concept, creating a 'cushion' of static, almost-solid water beneath each foot that the ninja stands on to avoid direct contact with the ground.

Chakra: 12 \+ G
Upkeep: 5
Speed: 6
Seal Speed: 14
Gallons Requirement: 0 \> 6
Requires: Water Walking Ability

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based

Effects: 
You reduce any immobilization penalties due to the condition of the ground you're crossing by G, and ignore any other mechanical effects (such as damage for walking across caltrops) if they're C\-rank or lower; if they're B-rank or above, you instead halve them. This does mean that you are not directly in contact with the ground (for the purposes of, say, the Doton jutsu Shindou and Yurokensei).

### **Suiton: Mizurappa \- Water Release: Violent Water Wave**

Inhaling a large amount of air and performing the necessary seals, the user will expel a copious amount of water from his/her mouth. The wave of water produced will slam against its opponent and can then be utilized for other techniques.

Chakra: 19
Damage: 8d10\+50
Range: 20
Area: 15
Speed: 14
Seal Speed: 10

Tags: Blunt, Projectile, AOE

Effects:  
This technique adds 5 gallons of water to the battlefield every time it's used.

### **Suiton: Suiben \- Water Release: Water Whip**

This creates, as its name suggests, a whip made from water which is held together by chakra. Aside from being a fairly useful weapon, it can prove useful for binding enemies, as the user can direct its motions with their chakra.

Chakra: 4 \+ G  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 6  
Seal Speed: 11  
Gallons Requirement: 6 \> 12

Tags: Weapon, Utility, Chain  

Effects: 
You create a whip of water, which has the following statistics:

(Medium, Blunt, Chain, One Handed)  
Chakra: 10  
Damage: 2+(G/2)d10  
Speed: 12  
Range: 5

The whip uses the higher of your Ninjutsu or Physical damage bonus. As with most ninjutsu weapons, you must keep one hand on the whip at all times, or it will break apart. The whip's maximum range is affected by the Improved Range ability. You may still perform handseals while holding the whip, but it increases their seal speed by 8 unless you have the ability to perform handseals one-handed. Actions taken with the whip, including Grapple and Weapon jutsu, replace their relevant Stamina costs with Chakra costs instead.

When using the jutsu Entangling Lash, the Water Whip makes the following adjustments:

You may use your weapon to grab ahold of someone, as per the E-rank Grapple technique. You use your CHA rather than your STR for grapple checks using the whip. If you know the B-rank Grapple technique 'Dragon Takedown', you may increase the Chakra cost of this technique to 20 and the speed to 18 to replicate that technique instead, using the whip's damage in place of the listed damage value.

Your opponent is considered to be 'clinching' the whip.

The whip has (CHA)/2 HP. Although the grappled target cannot attack it directly, any passive damage they deal to grapplers still works, and the whip can still be attacked (or suffer from being struck by an AoE) by outside sources.

The whip being destroyed ends the grapple. Your whip cannot be attacked if it is not being used to grapple someone.

The victim may break clinch or set-up as normal, grabbing and pulling the whip in order to do so.

You may perform any valid Grapple techniques that you know of C-rank or below, using your CHA in place of your STR and following usual restrictions. The following techniques may not be used by the whip: Headbutt, Suplex, Pressure Point.

The whip is considered to have unlimited limbs. This is accomplished by using your chakra to reshape the whip.

While being used in a grapple, your whip cannot be used to attack or with other jutsu.

You may direct Raiton techniques of C rank or lower through the whip \- used in this way, these techniques cannot miss. Directing a C-rank technique through the whip destroys the whip in the process.

### **Suiton: Mizuame Nabara \- Water Release: Syrup Capture Field**

The user converts chakra into water, and infuses it with enough chakra to alter its composition, making it extremely viscous. They then spit it out in a stream of sticky, highly adhesive liquid.

Chakra: 15 
Upkeep: 4  
Range: 25  
Area: 5  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 20

Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental

Effects:  
If a person has the ability to walk on water, they may cross this area without difficulty. Anyone else in the area suffers a -4 immobilization penalty.

This jutsu's effects persist for 50 IC even after you drop the upkeep. However, so long as the upkeep is maintained, you may control the syrup enough to have it try to 'grab' anyone using water-walking to cross it unaffected; if the attack hits, the person is stuck in the syrup as if they weren't using water-walking. This is a Speed 6 action, with a Chakra cost of 15.

### **Mizu Bunshin no Jutsu \- Water Clone Technique**

An advanced form of the standard Bunshin no Jutsu, this creates clones out of water. Since they're solid (well, relatively) these clones can be used to perform tasks the user is unable or unwilling to do for themselves. While they're weaker than their user, they can still prove dangerous in combat.

Chakra: 10 \+ G
Speed: 6 \+ X
Seal Speed: 10 \+ X
Gallons Requirement: 5 \* X

Tags: Utility, Clone

Effects: 
You create X clones. These function like normal clones (Limited to 3, automatically hidden amongst them, etc.), but you may direct them to take actions by spending your AP.

A clone can be created with a Sword (From the Standard Equipment options) in hand by spending an additional 2 Gallons of Water on each clone. You may spend up to your Chakra Control Artisan Points on upgrading these swords, splitting it between all of your clones. These clones use your regular attributes, except for half your ninjutsu damage bonus as their physical damage bonus. A water clone which takes damage from any source is destroyed.

\[1 AP\] Dodge, or Parry.  
\[Variable AP\] Move: The clone may move around the battlefield. This costs 1 AP per 2 IC it spends moving.  
\[Variable AP\] The clone may make any basic unarmed or weapon attack, by paying 1 AP per 2 Speed of that action.  
\[10 AP\] The clone can use itself to create a water prison (as per Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu). This is considered a Speed 14 action, and you must pay the Chakra cost rather than the clones. These water prisons require no Gallons of Water; the clone remains present, but can take no other non-defensive actions, while maintaining them. They last for 5 \+ (your Chakra Control ranks) IC, after which the clone expires and the prison ends; if you go to the prison you can take it over (During which, the clone will be destroyed), and from then on must keep one hand in contact with it as per the normal rules for that technique. 

When Water Clones attack the severity of wounds they inflict is reduced by one category. They also use your base Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion bonuses, as if they were a Fatigue 0 version of you without any temporary benefits (such as having eaten a Soldier Pill before creating them). If a clone advances a Fatigue, it vanishes just as if it had been struck.

### **Mizugakure no Jutsu \- Hidden in Water Technique**

The user sinks into a shallow pool of water, much too little to actually fit a person (it's ninja magic, don't ask questions), where they'll be able to easily lie in wait for a target to pass by, or spy on someone who might be near.

Chakra: 18  
Upkeep: 5  
Speed: 25  
Seal Speed: 14  
Requires: 10 Gallons of Water on the field

Tags: Utility, Ground-Based

Effects: 
You hide, and immediately enter Stealth 3. If an opponent does not have a reason to suspect you're there (i.e. this isn't being done in-combat) you have a +5 Stealth bonus. You maintain awareness of your surroundings outside of the pool as if it's a window.

The puddle being reduced below 10 gallons results in you being harmlessly ejected.

### **Suiton: Suirou no Jutsu \- Water Release: Water Prison Technique**

The user gathers the chakra around their hand, and forms the required water into a sphere which encloses its victim. Due to the density of the chakra used in this technique, the water is stronger than steel. It is not, however, airtight. Yeah, don't ask how that works. We don't know either.

Chakra: 13 \+ G
Upkeep: 6
Speed: 12
Seal Speed: 14
Accuracy: \-2
Gallons Requirement: 5 \> 12
Requires: 12 Chakra Control

Tags: Attack, Melee

Effects: 
If this Jutsu hits, the victim is trapped inside a sphere of water. People inside cannot take actions, but they also cannot be affected by anything outside the prison; yes, that's right, the water can even stop giant swords. It makes sense, honestly, we promise, somehow.

Anyone with a Chakra Control Rank of G*2 or above is able to mold the chakra around them to allow themselves to siphon air through the prison, meaning they can still talk and breathe. Any target with less CC, however, suffers a Suffocation 1 status every 10 IC. Additionally, every 5 IC this jutsu’s upkeep increases by 1.

To maintain the water prison, you must keep one hand on it. Dodging requires you to end the effect; if you take damage, you must make a Chakra Control check against a TN of 5+(damage taken)/10 or the prison ends. Although you can't move, you can still take most other actions that are possible one-handed while maintaining the prison's upkeep.

### **Umi no Tate no Jutsu \- Ocean Shield Technique**

A derivative of a more advanced technique, this was created to help teach up-and-coming suiton users the foundations of that jutsu, and help keep them alive until they were skilled enough to learn it. It creates a circular barrier of water around you, which surges up to protect you from... well, whatever convinced you that you'd need to use this technique.

Chakra: 6 \+ G \* 1.5
Speed: 8
Seal Speed: 8
Gallons Requirement: 6 \> 12

Tags: Interrupt

Effects:
You parry an incoming attack with a Bonus of +(G/2). This works against Katon up to A rank, Doton up to C-rank, and all other Jutsu (including Taijutsu) up to B-rank.

## **Suiton B-rank**

### **Suiton: Suigadan \- Water Release: Water Fang Bullet**

This move forms multiple pressurized, spiraling columns of water that have a drill-like ability to pierce and destroy their target. As this attack can originate from any body of water (rather than being shot directly from the attacker), in the right environments this has a 360 degree range of attack, making it incredibly difficult to defend against adequately.

Chakra: 15 \+ G
Damage: 8d20 \+ (G \* 10)
Range: 35
Speed: 14
Seal Speed: 16
Gallons Requirement: 6  \> 18
Special: \+2 Accuracy

Tags: Attack, Projectile, Piercing

Effects:
If there are at least 10 Gallons of Water left in the Background after this Technique is used (or one is, say, over a lake, river, or other body of water such as Syrup Capture Field), this Technique is automatically a Surprise Attack.

### **Suiton: Suiryuudan \- Water Release: Water Dragon Blast**

This technique shapes a large amount of water into a giant, dragon-shaped projectile which seeks out and crashes into whoever you direct it at. What it lacks for in complexity, it makes up for by being a highly effective tool in any Suiton using shinobi's arsenal.

Chakra: 16 \+ G
Damage: 12d8 \+ (G \* 14)
Range: 50
Speed: 18
Seal Speed: 22
Gallons Requirement: 10 \> 20
Special: Stun 10

Tags: Attack, Blunt, Projectile

### **Sution: Suijinheki \- Water Release: Water Encampment Wall**

This defensive technique creates a wall of water around you, which forms a violently churning defensive perimeter. When lacking water in the environment to use, a talented shinobi can form it in their stomach and spit it out.

Upkeep: 6
Chakra: 26
Area: 5
Speed: 12
Seal Speed: 12
Requires: 16 gallons of water or \+8 chakra cost

Tags: Interrupt, Environmental

Effects:  
If using Suijinheki as an interrupt: Make an accuracy roll against the attack's accuracy, with a \+6 bonus; if you succeed, this stops the attack entirely.

Once Suijinheki has been deployed, it lasts for your damage bonus in initiative counts--it automatically defends all attacks using your initial parry roll. You may also end it early, if you need to move or attack through it.

This technique protects you and anyone within its area from any Doton up to B-rank, and all other techniques (including taijutsu) up to A-rank.

### **Suiton: Bakusui Shouha \- Water Release: Exploding Water Shockwave**

The user creates an enormous amount of water by spewing it from their mouth, flooding the battlefield and potentially crushing foes in its path. Best of all, they get to look awesome while doing it\! The wave rises up from beneath the user, and they can 'ride' it to its destination.

Area: X \* 3
Speed: 16
Seal Speed: 30
Special: Stun X / 2

Tags: Blunt, AoE

Effects: 
The X in this jutsu is your ninjutsu damage bonus and produces that many gallons. This Technique's Speed cannot be reduced below 16 by any means and it cannot be Dodged unless you can completely escape the area.

As part of this technique, you may move up to half its Area in yards, in any direction. The Area of this Technique does not move with you - it remains centered on where your movement began.

### **Benzaiten no Jutsu \- River Goddess Technique**

Named after the deity who supposedly watches over a major river, this technique coats the user's body with a thin layer of chakra-infused water. It offers no real protection from impacts or weapons, but can be an effective supplement to one's defenses against heat and other unpleasantness.

Chakra: 5 \+ G
Upkeep: 3 \+ (G / 5)
Speed: 10
Seal Speed: 16
Requires: 10 \> 15
Special: Interrupt

Tags: Utility. Self

Effects: 
You end any ongoing ignites on you. So long as this is maintained you cannot gain any by Ignite or Burn statuses, and you take (10+G)% less damage from Katon Jutsu (applied after other reductions).

### **Suiton: Uramiame \- Water Release: Grudge Rain**

As a weather-manipulation jutsu, this technique is extremely taxing upon its user. Upon its completion a large storm cloud is created, which proceeds to, as storm clouds are prone to do, rain. This rain saps the chakra from anyone it comes in contact with, and transfers it through the pooling water to the technique's user.

Chakra: 30  
Upkeep: 6  
Area: 30 
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 24  
Tags: Utility, AoE, Environmental

Effects: 
Every 10 IC, everyone other than the user and up to (Chakra Control)/5 people they've designated as allies has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty increased by 1, and the user has their Chakra Exhaustion penalty decreased by 1 per person present affected by the rain. If the user moves, they may cause the mist to 'follow' them; It moves at a speed of 0.5 Yards per IC until the user is back in its center.

### **Suiton: Takitsubo no Jutsu: Water Release: Waterfall Basin Technique**

This technique drills a hole with existing water to an underground source of water and draws it forth, forming a geyser on the surface. The issue, however, as you may have guessed, is that you already need to have water on hand to make that hole, quite a bit in fact. Rocks tend to get quite tough to dig through once you reach the "Hidden sources of water" level. Gotta spend water to make water, just the way the world works, sorry. Aside from being useful for creating a spot to relax when resting or camping out, and ensuring you'll always have a source of clean water, it, like most ninjutsu, has combat applications. 

Chakra: 30  
Speed: 14  
Seal Speed: 17
Gallons Requirement: 10 \> 25

Tags: Utility, Environmental

Effects: 
This Technique adds (G/5) Gallons of Water onto the Background every 5 IC, for a Duration of 50 ICs.

## **Suiton A-rank**

### **Suiton: Suiryuuben \- Water Release: Water Hydra Whip**

This jutsu creates a levitating orb of water which can project numerous whips and tendrils of water. These tendrils can be guided to targets by remote manipulation of the orb's chakra, even changing direction in mid-trajectory to find their targets. On top of that, they're sharp-tipped and more than capable of perforating opponents many times over.

Chakra: 20 \+ (G / 5)  
Upkeep: 10  
Damage: 10d10\+75  
Range: 40 \+ 5 \* Ndb  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 35  
Gallons Requirement: 50 \> 100  
Tags: Utility, Environmental

Effects: 
When you first use this Technique, you create a levitating ball of water, and perform one Tendral Whipping Attack (mentioned below) for free. A So long as you maintain this technique, your pet giant levitating ball of water will fight for you\! It acts 1 IC after it's created and can take the following Actions, by spending your AP:

\[X AP, Speed X\] Move: It moves as if it had taken a Speed (X)\*5 action, using your CHA in place of its AGI. It cannot (deliberately) move outside its max range. If it does end up outside that range, it can take no actions other than moving towards you.

\[5+X AP, Speed 12\] Tendril Whipping: Your water ball attacks anyone within half this technique's max range, doing the above listed damage if it hits. This does piercing damage. You may target any number of people within range, increasing the AP cost by 1 for each person after the first. This always deals Damage as if it was Speed 12 . This does Piercing damage.

Additionally, the levitating water ball receives its own pool of AP equal to (G/2) which it may spend to perform the Action mentioned above and/or lower their own Speed.

This technique uses your Accuracy, unmodified by Statuses, Fatigue, Wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on. And your NDB. Because the attacks are made by the technique, and not you, you cannot modify them further such as through Willpower or your own AP.

### **Suiton: Daibakufu \- Water Release: Great Waterfall**

This is one of the most powerful water ninjutsu in existence; once the appropriate seals are formed, the user unleashes a devastating tidal wave which tears across the battlefield like a scaled-down tsunami, knocking aside people, trees, and small buildings in its path.

Long ago, exceptionally skilled shinobi were able to fill their impromptu waterfall with all manner of weapons, which were propelled within the wave at incredible speeds. This had the effect of making it an almost unavoidably deadly technique that would leave pools of blood mixed in with the water. However, use of that aspect of the technique was forbidden due to its unbelievable power, and as peace settled across the lands the secret of how to do that was lost.

Chakra: 30 \+ (G / 2)
Damage: (G \* 20)
Line: 20, 80
Speed: 36
Seal Speed: 30
Special: Stun 14
Gallons Requirement: 20 \> 40

Tags: Blunt, Projectile, AoE

Effects: 
This Technique pushes any targets hit with a Knockback of G.

### **Suiton: Daikoudan \- Water Release: Great Shark Blast**

This creates an enormous shark out of water and sends it crashing across the battlefield at whichever party has offended the user sufficiently for them to feel the need to do so. Aside from impacting its primary target, the shark is massive enough to cause significant collateral damage. The technique's true secret, however, is its ability to absorb any chakra it comes in contact with and use that energy to further empower itself.

Chakra: 34 \+ (G / 2)
Damage: 15d20\+(G \* 20)
Line: 5, 60
Speed: 20
Seal Speed: 26
Gallons Requirement: 12 \> 30

Tags: Attack, Interrupt, Projectile, Blunt, AoE

Effects: 
This may be used as an Interrupt, and you may choose to reduce this technique's Seal Speed by 10 and increase its Chakra cost by 10\. Regardless, as an interrupt, it only hits the Attacker.

Daikoudan may be used to Interrupt techniques so long as its Speed is equal to or less than theirs, but can only Interrupt Projectile Attacks. The two Attacks collide, and their Damage is compared. For this comparison, treat Katon Technqiues as dealing 25% less damage, and Doton as dealing 25% more. If the incoming attack does more damage, you are hit by it, but it has its damage reduced by half. If Daikoudan's damage is greater, it becomes an attack against the opponent with \+5 Accuracy, along with any Accuracy bonuses (but not penalties) of the attack it countered. It does an additional (X \* 10\) Damage, where X is the Chakra cost of the move it countered.

Similarly, if a ninjutsu-based defense is used against Daikoudan, and fails to stop it completely, it does full damage (bypassing even partial defense) and adds (X \* 10\) Damage, with X being the Chakra cost of the failed defense.

### **Dai Bakusui Shouha \- Great Exploding Water Shockwave**

A stronger but less directly offensive version of the B-rank Exploding Water Shockwave, the user spits out a truly prodigious amount of water.

Chakra: 46
Upkeep: 6
Damage: 50d10+200
Area: 100
Speed: 26
Seal Speed: 27
Special: Stun 15

Tags: Attack, AoE, Blunt, Environmental

Effects: 
This Technique uses half your NDB for Damage Calculation. This adds 30 Gallons of Water to the Background. So long as there are at least 40 Gallons in the Background at any time while this Technique's Upkeep is maintained, any Ground-Based Techniques (Such as Earth Split Turnaround Palm or Syrup Capture Field) become impossible to use. Regardless, all Suiton Techniques treat the maximum of their Gallons Requirement as if it was 5 higher.
Additionally, anyone who is standing in its Area will begin sinking even if they have the Water Walking Ability (The currents are simply too tumultuous). They can swim at half their normal movement speed (movement-increasing jutsu typically will not work), and until they've exited the area suffer Suffocation 1 every 10 IC. Alternatively, they can take a Speed 5 action to stay at the surface for the next 15 IC.

## **Medical D-rank**

### **Mukizu Shindan no Jutsu \- Flawless Diagnosis Technique**

By touching someone and sending pulses of chakra throughout the recipient's tenketsu, the user can learn of someone's vitals and condition faster than it would be to separately evaluate them. It requires the patient to be willing to do so, however, which is the cause of most medic-nin's stress while in training.

Chakra: 10  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 8, Delay 8

Effects:  
You know a target's Fatigue level, percent of remaining HP and Vitality, any wounds they're suffering from, any illnesses they have, any poisons they're afflicted with, and any other health issues they may be suffering from. These are in general terms. Your character knows they are "exhausted, but still have some energy left", not that they "are at Fatigue 4".  
In addition to telling you what's wrong with a person, this gives a \+5 bonus to any Medicine rolls to treat a person using mundane means (such as a First Aid kit).  
This cannot be used against an unwilling target. Well; it can't be used on an unwilling target who is also capable of resisting.

### **Shiketsu no Jutsu \- Tourniquet Technique**

A surprisingly medical technique, this throttles the flow of chakra to a specific portion of the body, and by doing so puts it in a state of near-hibernation. The entire limb becomes numb and almost unresponsive, but blood flow decreases and pains is significantly reduced.

Chakra: 15  
Range: Touch  
Upkeep: 2 per limb  
Speed: 15, Delay 5  
Requires: Flawless Diagnosis

Effects:  
This jutsu can be applied to any limb. The recipient loses the use of that limb, but ignores all effects of any wounds present on it.  
In the case of an arm that means it cannot be used to hold weapons, the amount of weapons you can multi-throw is reduced by 25%, and you cannot use that hand to form handseals.  
In the case of a leg this applies a \-25% to movement speed and a \-2 dodge penalty.  
This technique cannot be used offensively. You can, however, use it on yourself.

### **Kyuusho Shuuzen no Jutsu \- Vital Repair Technique**

By transferring your chakra to the recipient, you can stimulate the body to begin the recovery process and help stabilize their most basic functions (like breath rate and pulse). It lacks the precision of more advanced jutsu to target specific injuries and problems, but helps to keep people alive until they can receive advanced care.

Chakra: 10 \+ X/4  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 5 \+ X \* 2  
Special: Abort  
Requires: Flawless Diagnosis

Effects:  
As an action you activate Vital Repair on a willing target in range of touch. For the duration of this technique, you must keep your hands on its recipient. If you are stunned, or knocked away, it is Aborted automatically. 

For every IC which passes, you heal 1% of the recipient's lost Hit Points. This will not restore lost Vitality, though it will restore a person in negative Hit Points to consciousness.

You pay the cost of this technique after you finish healing where X is the number of IC this jutsu was active for.

A single person may benefit from this only once per day, per medic. You may use this technique on yourself (though still have to be able to place a hand on yourself to do so; no hands, no healing).

## **Medical C-rank**

### **Chakura no Mesu \- Chakra Scalpel**

This forms one's chakra into a small, sharp blade; medics favor this for performing highly accurate incisions during surgeries and dissection, as it won't lose its edge and is always sterile (unlike a regular blade). It can even be used to make cuts inside the body without creating an opening wound, which drastically reduces the risk of infection.

Chakra: 13  
Upkeep: 3  
Speed: 8

Effects:  
You can use this in combat. Doing so causes your unarmed taijutsu attacks to inflict Slashing wounds and ignore any damage reduction your opponent may have. However, these 'scalpel' injuries are relatively shallow. They cannot wound a location wearing armor, and armor is treated as if it has double the absorption against techniques that benefit from this.

The damage from basic attacks with your scalpel is increased by (your Medicine skill ranks)%. Additionally, the damage of all unarmed attacks (including basic attack) is increased by (Medicine skill ranks)% for determining the severity of wounds it inflicts. However this bonus does not apply to any jutsu that explicitly uses your legs to attack (such as Tsutenkyaku \- Painful Sky Leg).

You also gain a \+5 Bonus to performing Medicine Skill Checks that involve surgery or making any form of cuts or incisions on a person.

### **Kasoku Saikassei \- Accelerated Revitalization**

An advanced medical technique which temporarily allows the body to sustain itself by accelerating the body's metabolism and chakra reserves. It was originally developed to extend the medic's usefulness in prolonged missions, but has been expanded since. It is used sparingly because of how long it takes to recover from, and how it tends to leave people  
comatose afterward.

Chakra: 10 \+ X \* 3  
Range: Touch  
Upkeep: X \* 2  
Speed: 12  
Requires: Flawless Diagnosis

Effects:  
This lowers the recipient's effective Fatigue level by X, with X having a maximum of their current Fatigue level.  
A person can only benefit from one application of this technique. To apply it again, they must first release the previous instance of it--which may, potentially, render them immediately unconscious, if their "true" Fatigue level is 6 or higher. Notably, an unconscious person cannot benefit from this technique.

However, forcing one's body beyond its limits like this is costly. For the next X weeks, the recipient will not recover from Fatigue at all, even through the use of Soldier Pills (though another application of this technique would still function). If multiple instances of Kasoku Saikassei are delaying one's recovery, only the one with the longest time remaining is counted for that purpose.  
This technique cannot be used offensively.

### **Kizu Saishuu no Jutsu \- Wound Sealing Technique**

This technique uses chakra to make repairs to an injured body; gashes are pulled shut, wounds sutured, damaged organs held steady by the application of chakra. This can give an injured shinobi the second wind they need to win a battle or complete a mission.  
However, this is only a temporary measure; before long the chakra will unravel. As such, this is considered an emergency technique among medics, to be used only when there's no other choice. Most will hesitate to apply this to their comrades, as far too many shinobi will prove willing to, using this newfound health, charge into battle, defeat their enemies, and then die hours later when their borrowed time expires.

Chakra: 25  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 30, Delay 20  
Requires: Vital Repair Technique

Effects:  
The recipient immediately regains up 3\*(ninjutsu damage bonus)% of their maximum Vitality, which will not take them above half their maximum. However, 3\*(your ranks in medice) IC later, their wounds will reopen; they'll immediately take that much damage, \+50%, which cannot be reduced or mitigated. Until this occurs, they will not heal normally (i.e. as described in the Recovery section of the Combat chapter). This can be fatal.

### **Rinji Hougou no Jutsu \- Temporary Suture Technique**

Weaving a network of chakra, a medic can make short-term repairs to damaged body parts. They can set wounds and hold them rigidly in place, use chakra to take the place of damage muscles and tendons, alleviate swelling and bruising, or even repair damaged blood vessels and do the job of injured nerves.  
The problem with this is that it's a short-term fix to a long term problem. This is itself damaging, but beyond that it prevents the body from doing anything to repair itself, and allows undue strain to be placed on these injured body parts.

Chakra: 15 \+ 3 \* X  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 10 \+ 3 \* X, Delay 5 \+ X  
Requires: Tourniquet Technique

Effects:  
This temporarily negates the effects of up to X wounds; it can be applied later to negate additional wounds, without disrupting previous applications.  
This lasts for (the medic's ninjutsu damage bonus) hours, after which time the chakra sustaining the jutsu expires--and the recipient pays the price for pushing their body beyond its limits.  
For each wound remedied this way, they take damage equal to 5% of their maximum Vitality, per category of the wound.  
Thus, if this was used to negate a Minor and a Severe wound, after it ended the person would take (5 \+ 15\) \= 20% of their maximum Vitality in damage (which could carry over to their HP), which cannot be reduced or mitigated.  
Additionally, the recovery times of these wounds is increases by 1 week per level of the wound (1 week for minors, 3 for severes, etc.). In the case of wounds whose penalties are reduced over time, this "extra" recovery time must be made up for first, before normal recovery can continue.  
This can be fatal. It cannot be used on an unwilling subject (though as with its predecessor, Tourniquet Technique, you may use it on yourself). So long as this technique is in place, natural healing (as described in the Recovery section of the Combat chapter) will not take place.

### **Meguri Seigyo no Jutsu \- Hemostasis Technique**

Although this technique is fairly simple, it's not taught to amateur medics due to the danger inherent in making any sort of mistake when applying it. This temporarily adjusts the recipient's pulse and blood flow, putting their body in a more stable condition. This is mainly used to prevent someone from bleeding out, and to prevent the spread of poison.

Chakra: 10 \+ X \* 2  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 6 \+ X, Delay X / 2

Effects:  
This lasts for X \* 5 IC. During that time, the damage the recipient takes from Bleed effects is reduced to 0, the Stamina penalties from Bleed effects are not applied, and they take damage from Poison once every 2 IC, rather than every IC. The severity of Bleed statuses is reduced normally.  
During this time, they have a \+5 bonus to all their Resistance rolls.

## **Medical B-rank**

### **Shousen no Jutsu \- Mystical Palm Technique**

In many ways the pinnacle of medical ninjutsu, this allows the user to dramatically accelerate the body's natural healing process by using chakra to stimulate it. This lets them heal a patient without the need for medical equipment, surgery, or even ordinary healing times. Despite the incredible skill required in matching the distribution of chakra to the severity of injuries, this looks incredibly simple: the medic places their faintly-glowing palms on the recipient, and injuries begin to vanish.

Chakra: 10 \+ X / 2  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 5 \+ X  
Special: Abort  
Requires: Vital Repair

Effects:  
For the duration of this technique, you must keep your hands on its recipient. If you are stunned, or knocked away, it is Aborted automatically. The value of X is determined, and the Chakra cost paid, after it ends. This paragraph should seem familiar.  
Every IC which passes, you heal 1% of the recipient's Vitality. This will not heal lost Hit Points. You pay the cost of this technique after you finish healing, based on its actual duration. If you Abort it, or are forced to, X is reduced appropriately. A single person may benefit from this only once per day, per medic.  
You may use this technique on yourself, as with Vital Repair.

### **Fukugen Ryouhou \- Rejuvenating Remedy**

An advanced technique in which, with a touch, the user sends a pulse of chakra throughout the body of their target, which corrects disruptions in the user's chakra flow and the nerves and blood vessels which they follow throughout the body. It is widely rumored to have been developed by a Hyuuga medic  
nin.

Chakra: 30  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 10

Effects:  
This clears the person touched of immobilization and paralysis penalties which are internal (Poison, clay bullet, etc. would not apply, but notably, Combat Acupuncture and Nervous System Derangement would). It immediately ends any stuns which are presently affecting them.  
It is also strong enough to disrupt weaker Genjutsu, granting another defensive roll against a single Genjutsu affecting them of C rank or lower, with a \+5 bonus.

### **Saikan Chuushutsu no Jutsu \- Delicate Illness Extraction Technique**

A delicate and advanced technique even among medical ninjutsu, this is nonetheless exceptionally useful. The medic makes an incision on the patient's body (usually the torso, but other locations are possible) and then uses chakra to draw out any poisons, toxins, or other pathogens that may be afflicting the person.

Chakra: 30  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 18, Delay 8  
Requires: Chakra Scalpel

Effects:  
This immediately cures any poisons a person may be suffering from. Most parasites, diseases, and chemical toxins can also be excised this way.

### **Kyouka Shohou: Chakura Chuunyuu \- Strengthening Prescription: Chakra Injection**

Originaly developed as a kinjutsu, the version used by medics today is a safer (though still by no means safe) derivative.  
Using medically-altered chakra, an individual can be greatly, if temporarily, strengthened. Unfortunately, they are burning their proverbial candle at both ends when under the effects of this technique.

Chakra: 35  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 25, Delay 20

Effects:  
The recipient has their ninjutsu and physical damage bonuses increased by one half of your ninjutsu damage bonus, and receives a bonus to Stamina and Chakra Exhaustion rolls equal to your base, unmodified ninjutsu damage bonus.  
However, whenever they fail a Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion roll, their Fatigue is raised an additional category.  
Additionally, any time their Stamina or Chakra Exhaustion penalty increases, the other is increased by the same amount.  
These effects last until the end of the fight (or other encounter, if used out of combat for some reason). And cannot be aborted or stopped prematurely.

## **Medical A-rank**

### **Chikatsu Saisei no Jutsu \- Healing Resuscitation Regeneration Technique**

The pinnacle of advanced common medical jutsus, with effects that border upon miraculous, this stimulates the body's stem cells to begin dividing and recreating a lost or destroyed part of the body--such as a limb or organ. In time, full functionality will be regained.  
Doing so, however, is incredibly difficult, even for experienced medical nin. In the rare instance when this technique is performed, multiple medics will usually work in tandem.

Chakra: 50  
Speed: 100  
Seal Speed: 200

Effects:  
A medic involved in this technique makes the Chakra roll, and then spends 1 Willpower towards the regeneration process. A total of 50 Willpower must be spent this way, but the process cannot be completed in less than 10 weeks; at least 1 Willpower must be spent each week, or all progress is lost. After the last point of Willpower is added, the user regains their lost limb, organ, or body part.  
During this time, the recipient cannot go above Fatigue 2\. If they do, at any point and for any reason, all progress is lost.

### **Kyuushou Taisha \- Vital Regeneration**

The medic-nin focuses their chakra on a specific part of the body and, using what is left of the damaged organ or area, forces a rapid replication of specific types of cells. It is capable of mending broken bones and repairing ruptured organs with astonishing speed.

Chakra: 20 \+ 10 \* X  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 50, Delay 40  
Requires: Mystical Palm

Effects:  
This completely cures one wound the recipient is suffering from. X is 1 per severity of the wound (1 for minor, 4 for critical). However, for the next X \* 4 weeks, the healed individual's Fatigue is considered 1 higher for all purposes; in the case of Critical wounds, their Fatigue is considered 2 higher. Multiple uses of this stack.  
For example, say you had a Critical wound and a Major wound cured on the same day. You would be perpetually at Fatigue 3 for the next 2 \* 4 \= 8 OOC days. After that, there would still be 8 more days (for a total of 16, for the Critical wound) of being unable to go below Fatigue 2\. If you had another two Severe wounds healed this way in that time, you'd be at Fatigue 4 until the after-effects started wearing off.  
Although most experienced medics know this technique, they are typically reluctant to cure every individual who injures themselves in training or on a mission. Most medics believe that even if the person doesn't need to learn a lesson for their mistakes, it's better to heal naturally (with a little bit of help when necessary) than to send a weakened, but technically uninjured, ninja back into danger.

### **Mikiri Saisei \- Forsaken Rebirth**

A powerful, but potentially dangerous, technique, this allows the medic to transform a portion of their 'life energy' to another individual. Originally, this had no limitatuons; a medic could easily kill themselves bring an ally back from the brink of death, which earned the technique its name. Over time, such extreme measures became less necessary (medics capable of using it were, after all, generally more valuable to the village than anyone they might be healing), and the version of the technique taught to medical nin was altered to prevent that.

Chakra: 20  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 20, Delay 10

Effects:  
After paying the chakra cost, you may 'spend' additional Fatigue levels (though you may not render yourself unconscious by doing this) to improve this technique's effects.  
In fact, without spending Fatigue this way, it does nothing at all. You may not use this technique on yourself.  
Each Fatigue level heals 20% of the recipient's HP and 10% of their Vitality, and lowers their Fatigue level by by 1, in addition to resetting their Chakra and Stamina penalties to 0\.  
Each Fatigue level also allows them to ignore one wound they already have of their choice for the next X in-character days, where X is the total number of Fatigue spent. All their Minor wounds must be ignored before this can move on to Major, and all their Major before they can move on to Severe.  
This cannot be used to ignore Critical wounds.

### **Basic Seal**

A foundational seal that is designed to be placed on the field rather than on scrolls, making it highly adaptable for all surfaces and terrains. And durable enough that it cannot be removed or stripped off without the aid of an unsealing jutsu. By itself, this seal does nothing, but by linking to other instances of this same jutsu, and applying a central seal, it can perform a variety of effects reliant on channeling chakra into various shapes. This particular use makes it THE ideal way to form and decide the shape of barriers and other such techniques.

Chakra: 15  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 30  

Effects:  
When you perform this Jutsu, you apply a Seal on a fixed object (Such as the ground or a tree) within the square you're standing on. Every time you do so, if there are other Seals created by this Technique on the battlefield, you may assign your Seal to be linked to them. Creating a line between the two Seals that can be turned into one side or wall of a Barrier or other Techniques that require this Jutsu. Each Seal can only be linked to a maximum of two other Seals.

For example, you can create three Seals, link Seal 1 to Seal 2, Seal 2 to Seal 3, and Seal 3 back to Seal 1, thereby creating a triangle shape between the three of them with each Seal acting as one corner/point of the triangle.

The Seals created by this Jutsu cannot be removed or destroyed without an Unsealing Jutsu. You cannot Link two Seals with each other if they are more than your NDB yards apart.

Chakra: 18  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 30  

Effects:  
Roll a chakra control roll vs the 10 + the Chakra Control bonus of the caster of a Basic Seal. On a success you remove a seal made using Basic Seal. You gain a \+3 bonus for every time you’ve attempted this jutsu on a specific Basic Seal. Any Sealing jutsu activated with that seal are maintained as long as at least 1 seal remains.

## **Sealing D-rank**

### **Kankin Kanshihon Fuuin \- Confinement Scroll Seal**

This technique requires a blank scroll and something to write with. A series of symbols are written on the scroll, various items are placed on top of it, and the user performs the proper handseals. The items will vanish, stored inside the seal until they're released. This can be done repeatedly, with each item corresponding to a separate symbol on the scroll.  
Items can be sealed and released all at once, or one at a time.

Chakra: 10  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 10

Effects:  
This stores solid objects up to 100 Storage Points, which is an abstract value meant to take in both the weight and volume of an object into account. Releasing any number of items is a Chakra 5, Speed 5 action, which can be done by anyone who knows this technique. If used to release a weapon, it takes a separate action to 'draw' (grab and properly grasp) that weapon.

### **Soshoryu \- Twin Rising Dragons**

This requires two storage scrolls with projectile weapons stored inside of them. When this technique is used both the scrolls are launched into the air (giving the technique its name). The user can then jump up between them, grabbing and throwing various projectiles.

Stamina: Variable.  
Chakra: 10+X  
Range: As weapons used.  
Speed: Variable  
Seal Speed: 8  
Requires: Two scrolls with thrown weapons sealed inside them.

Effects:  
You unseal and throw weapons. This is a regular multi-throw, but you add CHA/4 to your DEX when determining how many weapons you can throw with X being the number of weapons added by this jutsu. Notably, this can't be done with Senbon.  
While Soshoryu itself is (obviously) a ninjutsu technique, the multi-throw attack you perform as part of it is a ranged taijutsu attack.

### **Sougu: Baku Ryuusei \- Manipulated Tools: Attached Meteor**

Large, elongated sections of chains with weighted ends shoot out of a scroll and are directed toward an opponent. They spiral around and surround the victim before the slack is removed, binding the opponent and restricting movement. It does minimal damage on its own, but is useful as a setup for a more potent attack.

Chakra: 16  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 8  
Range: 12

Effects:  
You make a Ranged Taijutsu Attack. If you hit, this deals no damage but restrains the opponent by wrapping chains around their limbs to prevent them from utilizing them. The target is considered to be in a clinch with the chains. Then you may choose arm or leg and they receive the penalties of either the Arm Lock or Leg Lock grapple jutsu.

The chains themselves are still attached to the scroll, and therefore sufficient movement on the part of the victim will end the effect. The scroll is anchored to the spot where the target was originally hit by this jutsu. Once the user has moved a number of yards equal to your ranks in Chakra Control from that spot they break free and this jutsu ends. Alternatively, they can try to just wrestle free as a Speed 6 action, rolling 1d20+STR/5 against your 1d20+CHA/5. They gain a penalty to this roll equal to their grapple penalty.

You may use this against a target already affected by Manipulated Tools: Attached Meteor in which case its speed and chakra cost is halved. You may choose arm or leg and add another application of Arm or Leg Lock. When the original Manipulated Tools: Attached Meteor ends this one ends as well.

### **Shikoku Fuuin \- Finger Engraving Seal**

Concentrating chakra into your fingertip, this allows you to 'write' on any surface you please. On solid objects, this will cause a slight depression on the surface and stain it black. On flesh, this will cause slight discomfort and leave a scar, which is initially ink-black and lightens over the next few weeks to regular scar tissue.

Chakra: 15  
Speed: 1 per word  
Seal Speed: 15  
Requires: 10 Chakra Control

Effects:  
You can write on any surface. With chakra\! This lasts a number of minutes equal to your ranks in chakra control.

## **Sealing C-rank**

### **Teisō Kaifū \-  Lesser Unseal**

The user focuses chakra through their fingers to break the structure of the targeted seal, usually with a forceful thrust. The lowest tier of unsealing jutsu capable of ending the effects of only the most basic of sealing jutsu.

Chakra: 20  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
You can target a single D-rank or lower seal on an object or person. That seal is removed and all of its effects are ended. This can also remove seals created by the Sealing Fulfillment Technique.

### **Fuukoku Houin \- Dark Sealing Method**

A once-specialized technique that's been adapted to see broader use, the Dark Sealing Method is used when a simple lock just isn't reliable enough. The user takes several paper tags, writes the appropriate seals on them in their own blood, and then applies them to the edge of the doorframe, lid, or other appropriate edge of what's being sealed. After that, the handseals are performed and chakra is applied.

Chakra: 30  
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 30

Effects:  
The door or container the paper tags are placed upon cannot be opened so long as this seal is in place; no amount of physical force can overcome it. That said, it gives no special properties to what has been sealed; if you apply Fuukoku Houin to a rickety wooden door, most people would have minimal trouble breaking a hole in the center of that door.  
The tags themselves are virtually indestructible until the technique ends.  
When you apply this seal, you may specify a certain time for it to end, such as "two days from now". The seal will last until the designated time arrives, or it's removed by some method (such as the B-rank Tier 2 Unseal). The person who placed this seal can simply peel the tags away from the sealed surface, destroying the seal in the process.

### **Sougu: Tensasai \- Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain of Destruction**

An advanced form of Twin Rising Dragons, the user throws a scroll into the air and activates it. In midair the weapons inside the scroll are released and projected by the user's chakra, allowing them to guide far more weapons than they would be able to by hand. It gets its name from the speed of its most proficient practitioners, who can propel their weapons so fast they appear as rays of light.

Chakra: 15 \+ X  
Damage: As Multi-Throw   
Area: 25  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 8  
Requires: Minimum of 25 Projectiles of a single Type

Effects:

X is the amount of Projectiles thrown in each Shower. Your Scroll is launched into the air, where it remains stationary. Every 10 IC afterwards, for 50 IC, the scroll showers each Target in its Area with one type of Throwing Weapon Projectiles chosen beforehand (Shuriken, Kunai, Senbon).

Each 'Projectile Shower' is a Multi-Throw Attack that strikes everybody in its Area, a certain amount of Projectiles each shower decided when initially performing this Jutsu. You must load the full number of Projectiles this technique will use into it ahead of time; if it runs out of Projectiles early, it stops.

For example, if the Scroll was firing 10 Senbon per Shower at 4 Targets, you'd need a total of 10  \* 4 \* 5 \= 200 Senbon loaded in the Scroll to make the full 5 Attacks.

Targets may defend against these attacks as if they're Speed 5 \+ X/2. And you use that same Speed value for the purpose of Damage Calculations.

This technique uses your base Accuracy for an C-Rank Weapon Taijutsu modified by the Accuracy bonus of the Projectile, and unmodified by status, wounds, temporary bonuses, and so on, though penalties from Fatigue do apply. and if you had Senbon User and used Senbon then these Showers gain that \+1 Accuracy Bonus.

It uses your Ninjutsu Damage Bonus at the time you initially launched the Scroll. And you receive the benefits of your Weapon Focus for the Projectile should you use it. However, because the Attacks are made by the Scroll, and not you, you cannot modify them further (such as with Willpower or AP).

### **Netetsuki no Jutsu \- Sleeping Moon Technique**

An exceptionally useful technique, as it approaches the much yearned-for concept of a "smart" seal; one that can be deactivated easily without requiring extensive time and effort to then replace it.  
This is not actually a seal itself, but a large number of specific modifications which can be applied to almost any advanced sealing technique; less complicated sealing jutsu are too simple to incorporate these alterations.

Chakra: \+15 \+ X \* 3  
Seal Speed: \+10 \+ X \* 5

Effects:  
This is used to supplement another sealing technique of rank C or higher. When you apply it, specify an activation condition and a deactivation condition.  
Possible triggers include:  
\> Someone passes within (up to 10\) yards of it.  
\> There is nobody within (up to 10\) yards of it.  
\> A certain word is said or noise is made.  
\> Someone touches the seal.  
\> A specific person touches the seal (see below).  
If keyed to touch-activation or \-deactivation by specific people, you can specify up to X people, where X is (Research ranks)/5, who the seal will recognize by chakra signature; all of those people must be present when you apply the seal.  
When the activation condition occurs, the seal is activated.  
When the deactivation condition occurs, the seal becomes dormant; none of its effects apply until it's reactivated, though it remains visible.  
Removing the seal augmented by Sleeping Moon Technique also removes this portion of the seal. Alternately, the Sleeping Moon seal could be removed, leaving the original seal in place but uncontrollable.

### **Tsuiseki Fuuin \- Tracking Seal**

A very useful seal, though one which suffers from a number of limitations. When applied to a person, the seal vanishes almost immediately, becoming invisible and virtually undetectable, even to shinobi capable of seeing chakra (such as the Hyuuga and Uchiha). Afterwards, whoever applied the seal will be able to get a vague idea of the location of the sealed individual, allowing them to be tracked across any distance.

Chakra: 20, raised to 30 if it hits  
Accuracy: \-6  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 25  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
Used as an attack, you are allowed an Espionage roll with a \+5 bonus against the opponent's. If you succeed, they think you struck a glancing blow with a close-range attack; if you fail, they realize you used some sort of jutsu on them, though not what its effect was.  
Once applied, the seal is invisible and undetectable. It will only be discovered by a sealing expert who knows to look for it. These seals have been known to go undetected for years, as a result.  
You may only have one Tracking Seal applied at a time (though one person can have multiple Tracking Seals placed on them); if you use it on another person, your link to the other seal is broken, and that seal unravels harmlessly.  
By forming a handseal and concentrating for several seconds you know the direction and approximate distance from your current location of the person you're tracking. This does not provide any bonuses in combat; while it lets you know your target is nearby, it lacks enough precision at such short distances to help you discover an opponent hidden in stealth. There is no limit on how often you may activate a Tracking Seal, though you have to stop and concentrate each time (and so cannot do it while moving).

### **Fūinrikō No Jutsu \- Sealing Fulfillment Technique**

A foundational seal that is designed to be placed on the field rather than on scrolls, making it highly adaptable for all surfaces and terrains. And durable enough that it cannot be removed or stripped off without the aid of an unsealing jutsu. By itself, this seal does nothing, but by linking to other instances of this same jutsu, and applying a central seal, it can perform a variety of effects reliant on channeling chakra into various shapes. This particular use makes it THE ideal way to form and decide the shape of barriers and other such techniques.

Chakra: 15  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 8  
Seal Speed: 15

Effects:  
When you perform this Jutsu, you apply a Seal on a fixed object (Such as the ground or a tree) within the square you're standing on. Every time you do so, if there are other Seals created by this Technique on the battlefield, you may assign your Seal to be linked to them. Creating a line between the two Seals that can be turned into one side or wall of a Barrier or other Techniques that require this Jutsu. Each Seal can only be linked to a maximum of two other Seals.

For example, you can create three Seals, link Seal 1 to Seal 2, Seal 2 to Seal 3, and Seal 3 back to Seal 1, thereby creating a triangle shape between the three of them with each Seal acting as one corner/point of the triangle.

The Seals created by this Jutsu cannot be removed or destroyed without an Unsealing Jutsu. You cannot Link two Seals with each other if they are more than your Ranks in Chakra Control apart

### **Kensetsu Kabe \- Construction Wall**

(Flavor Text)

Chakra: 19  
Area: Special  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 16

Effects:   
This Jutsu can be used if there is two or more Linked Seals created by the Sealing Fulfillment Jutsu. This Jutsu must be placed somewhere alongside one of the lines Linking the Seals. Once this is done, a 10 Yard tall Barrier is erected in the shape formed by the Linked Seals, and the Linked Seals become impossible to remove even through Unsealing Jutsus . This Barrier has (NDB \* 20\) HP and (Research Ranks \* 5\) DR and is completely impassable. 

Any Attacks (Even Non-Damage Dealing) whose path must pass through a square taken up by a part of this Barrier will instead be blocked by it, dealing Damage to the Barrier. If an Attack takes this Barrier down to 0 HP, then the leftover Damage (but no other Effects) will pass through to their intended Target. AoE Attacks which originate from one side of the Barrier and whose Area is meant to reach the other side of the Barrier, do not hit that other side and are instead blocked by the Barrier.

Successfuly performing an Unsealing Jutsu of a sufficient enough Rank on the spot where Construction Wall's Seal was performed causes it to be removed, and the Linked Seals forming the shape of its Barrier to be removed and wiped away as well. 

### **Shiroheisa Shigeto \- Castle Closing Four Gates**

(Flavor Text)

Chakra: 24  
Area: Special  
Speed: 16  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
This Jutsu can only be used if there is an Area encased by four Linked Seals created by the Sealing Fulfillment Jutsu. This Jutsu must be placed somewhere within the bounds of the encased Area. Once this is done, a 10 Yard tall Barrier is erected, and the Linked Seals become impossible to remove even through Unsealing Jutsus . Any physical objects that attempt to pass through the Barrier will very quickly disintegrate. This Barrier can deal (Research Ranks) \* 100 Damage before it's rendered inert and goes away on its own.

Any Taijutsu Projectile Attacks that must pass through one of the bounds of the Barrier are instantly destroyed, never reaching their Target. Any non-Energy Ninjutsu Projectile Attacks that pass through one of the bounds of the Barrier have their Damage halved, but maintain any other Effects as normal. Neither case counts for the amount of Damage the Barrier can deal before it’s inert.

If a person attempted to pass through the bounds of the Barrier, then they will receive (Research Ranks) \*  (NDB) Energy Damage, at this point, they are allowed to perform a Speed 2 Interrupt to cancel their movement and stop at the edge of the Barrier on the side they were already on, ceasing from taking that Damage. If they were pushed through the Barrier (Such as through a Knockback Effect), then they are allowed to make an Athletics Check against a TN of (15+Knockback Severity) to immediately end the Knockback Effect at the edge of the Barrier, taking no Damage. The same applies if they are being dragged across the Barrier during a Grapple, except that it's an Opposed Athletics Check instead.

Successfuly performing an Unsealing Jutsu of a sufficient enough Rank on the spot where Shiroheisa Shigeto's Seal was performed causes it to be removed, and the Linked Seals forming the shape of its Barrier to be removed and wiped away as well.

## **Sealing B-rank**

### **Chūsō Kaifū \-  Medium Unseal**

The user focuses chakra through their fingers to break the structure of the targeted seal, usually with a forceful thrust. The highest tier of generalist unsealing jutsu able to end all but the most powerful sealing jutsu. 

Chakra: 30  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 25

Effects:  
This can target a single C-rank or lower seal on an object or person. That seal is removed and all of its effects are ended.

### **Keiyaku Fuuin \- Contract Seal**

Implemented on a summoner, this removes any control the summoner has over their summoned creature, and in most cases will temporarily nullify the contract altogether.

Chakra: 40  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 16  
Seal Speed: 25

Effects:  
Any summoning contracts the victim possesses are considered null and void until this seal is removed. In most cases, this will forcibly de-summon anything they've already summoned. Defensive Summoning techniques used against this automatically fail.

### **Tsuyome Fuuin \- Strengthening Seal**

An advanced and demanding seal, this applies a resilient lattice of chakra to enhance the physical integrity of walls, floors, ceilings, and the like.

Chakra: 45  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 40

Effects:  
This may be applied to any surface up to (CHA /10) square yards, and no thicker than (CHA /10) inches. You may divide the area by any whole number to multiply the thickness limitation by that much. For example, you could make it (CHA /10)/2 square yards, and in exchange apply the seal to a surface (CHA /10)\*2 inches thick.  
The seal is visible, though only on the side it's applied to (so if it's on the inside of a wall, you would not see it on the outside). Similarly, it can only be removed from that side. It may only be applied to a contiguous object: if you wanted to apply Strengthening Seal to a boat, each plank would require a separate seal.  
The surface this seal is on is virtually indestructible. It gains (user's CHA)\*10 HP, and has a damage reduction of (user's CHA), which cannot be bypassed or reduced.  
This seal can only be applied to flat surfaces, such as walls.

### **Shinsei Chinmoku Fuuin \- Sacred Silence Seal**

Often used as a form of so-called 'loyalty seal', this has seen moderate popularity among various clandestine and/or extremist organizations within the ninja villages, as well as a means of helping ensure that double agents don't turn into triple agents.

Chakra: 30  
Accuracy: \-4  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 18

Effects:  
When you apply this seal to a person, specify a topic. This may be as broad ("anything involving Sand village") or as narrow ("the new jutsu you saw me use") as you wish.  
The victim may not attempt to communicate about that topic in any way, be it through speech, writing, or other methods. Intent is what matters here; if they think they're giving information about the subject, they are unable to.  
The same restrictions apply regarding this seal itself. That said, it's not particularly inconspicuous. While the seal itself prevents the from showing it off, it takes the form of a hexagram on their Tongue.  
You may, when applying this seal, also specify one exception to its restrictions. For example, you could say "other Leaf nin"--in which case the person with this seal could talk to other Leaf nin about the sealed topic, but nobody else.  
This seal trumps any genjutsu short of the Poison Truth Technique.

### **Jinshikyū Tojikomeru \- Life Entrapping Womb**

(Flavor Text)

Chakra: 32  
Area: Special  
Speed: 20  
Seal Speed: 24

Effects:

This Jutsu can only be used if there is an Area encased by four Linked Seals created by the Sealing Fulfillment Jutsu. This Jutsu must be placed somewhere within the bounds of the encased Area. Once this is done, a 10 Yards tall Barrier is erected and the Linked Seals become impossible to remove even through Unsealing Jutsus . Non-Chakra based objects can freely pass through this Barrier, however, any Jutsus or objects made with Chakra passing through the Barrier are mitigated, oftentimes to nothingness. Projectile Ninjutsu Attacks of C Rank or lower are completely nullified, while B Ranks have their Damage halved and lose any other Effects they had, and A Ranks remain completely unaffected. Clones of any kind besides Shadow Clones are also instantly destroyed. People and Summons can pass through completely fine, however, any Upkeeps they had are instantly ended.

It is also impossible to Target somebody with a purely Line of Sight Jutsu (Such as Genjutsu) if they are on the other side of the Barrier. 

Successfully performing an Unsealing Jutsu of a sufficient enough Rank on the spot where Life Entrapping Womb's Seal was performed causes it to be removed, and the Linked Seals forming the shape of its Barrier to be removed and wiped away as well.

## **Sealing A-rank**

### **Kōsō Kaifū \-  Greater Unseal**

The user focuses chakra through their fingers to break the structure of the targeted seal, usually with a forceful thrust. The highest tier of generalist unsealing jutsu able to end all but the most powerful sealing jutsu. 

Chakra: 40  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 12  
Seal Speed: 30

Effects:  
This can target a single B-rank or lower seal on an object or person. That seal is removed and all of its effects are ended.

### **Gogyou Fuuin \- Five Elements Seal**

This jutsu produces a powerful seal that disrupts the flow of chakra in the target. In most cases this is crippling.

Chakra: 50  
Accuracy: \-5  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 15  
Seal Speed: 50

Effects:  
The unfortunate victim has a \-25 penalty to all Chakra Exhaustion rolls, and has their Chakra Control skill ranks reduced by 15, which can also temporarily lower their ranks in abilities (such as Water Walking). Any jutsu with Upkeeps they have activated end immediately due to the disruption of their chakra.  
If they fail a Chakra Exhaustion roll, they fail to use the jutsu they were trying to (but still advance a Fatigue category as normal). Furthermore, even if they succeed they must pass a Chakra Control check against the technique's Chakra cost or fail anyway.

### **Fuuja Houin \- Evil Sealing Method**

Not all seals can be removed easily. This circumvents that by suppressing fuuinjutsu, or any sort of chakra-based markings, on a person. The technique's greatest failing is its dependence upon the recipient to provide some of the strength behind it, meaning they can overcome its effects at will, making it useless for offensive applications.

Chakra: 40  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 10  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
This suppresses any seal in this section of the PHB, and many which are not. While the seal won't be removed, it won't activate or have any of its normal effects as long as the Evil Sealing Method remains in place.  
This technique is dependent upon the recipient's willpower.  
All a person has to do is focus and the Evil Sealing Method will be disabled, until they spend 1 Willpower to reactivate it.  
The technique's quite useful. Virtually any long-term chakra-based effect (even ones that aren't actually fuuinjutsu) can be suppressed by it. Even the effects and abilities of bloodlines can be sealed.

### **Tsute Fuuin \- Influence Seal**

This seal was originally created and placed upon servants of the Immortal Water Diamyo, ensuring those closest to them could not spy or sabotage the feudal lords. Over time, shinobi adapted to suit their own needs, which naturally meant that it found a usage in combat.

Chakra: 40  
Range: Touch  
Speed: 14, \+10 if it hits  
Seal Speed: 20

Effects:  
You use your Accuracy for an unarmed Taijutsu attack, and if you hit, you roll opposed Espionage (Partial Defense does not apply). If you succeed in your Espionage roll, the seal is placed without the target knowing.  
As part of this technique, you may either make a basic unarmed taijutsu attack or use the E-rank Grab technique (if you know it), at no additional Speed or Stamina cost.  
The seal is inactive by default, but as a Speed 10, Chakra 10 \+ X action, you can create a temporary form of paralysis which turns their own Chakra against them, preventing them from taking any non-Interrupt actions. They declare their intended action along with its Accuracy and Speed, but roll a Chakra X\*2. If they fail, they are not fatigued and do not roll the Chakra or Stamina rolls associated with their action.  
Their IC is not advanced by the action's Speed, but they suffer a Stun 5 which cannot be reduced or negated.  
When applying this seal, "X" has a maximum value of your current bonus to Chakra Exhaustion rolls, including Fatigue bonuses but ignoring any non-Upkeep penalties.  
Every time that a victim has previously had to roll against this seal's effects, they gain a \+3 to their Chakra Exhaustion roll to overcome its effects. After they've succeeded against even one of these rolls, the seal is forced into remission, and will not affect them any more; it cannot be reapplied or reactivated for the rest of that fight.  
Once the seal is subdued, it is, as far as the victim can tell, gone entirely, its effects having been broken. However, after 24 hours have passed the seal can be reactivated by its user, per the normal rules. An expert in sealing jutsu will be able to, if they know someone has had this seal applied to them, find and remove it using the A-rank Five Elements Unseal technique.
